            begins in mid-crisis. Two girls sit on a bed and suck up a can of
            Dust-Off. Shot in a series of close-ups, they lapse into a sort of
            delirium. &quot;I can't feel anything,&quot; giggles the blond one,
            Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood). The dark one, temptress Evie (Nikki Reed),
            claims to hear a sound in her head: &quot;That's your brain cells
            popping!&quot; squeals Tracy, just before they start hitting each
            other, just to feel something. They're both surprised when they
            knock each other off the bed, raising welts and drawing blood. They
            laugh again. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cutting
            back from this girl-bonding commotion to four months earlier, <i>Thirteen</i>
            traces how Tracy and Evie came to this unpretty place. While the
            course is simplified for popular consumption, the story is
            compelling, even urgent, particularly if you know any
            thirteen-year-olds who are feeling alienated, angry, or
            self-destructive. Pale and willowy, Tracy starts out as an apparent
            &quot;good girl.&quot; Living with her single mom Melanie (Holly
            Hunter) and slightly older brother Mason (Brady Corbet) in a
            low-rent section of Los Angeles, she does her homework, doesn't make
            waves, and looks after her mom, a recovering addict and at-home
            hairdresser who tends to lose track of her hair gel during
            appointments. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beneath
            her seeming self-possession, however, Tracy's in trouble. She
            resents dad's absence and mom's chaos, not to mention Mel's
            on-again-off-again boyfriend, Brady (Jeremy Sisto), also a
            recovering addict; their relationship is plainly compassionate and
            even fun, but they just as plainly have a history they're trying not
            to revisit. Tracy's angry at both -- her mother for seeming weak and
            Brady for giving her scary memories (him doing drugs in the
            kitchen), to which she flashes back on cue. In search of some sense
            of order, Tracy has been cutting herself, keeping a scissors and a
            bloody rag hidden in the bathroom for late-night self-damage
            sessions. Heading back to school, new to seventh grade, Tracy's
            hardly noticed. But, like everyone else, she takes definite notice
            of classmate Evie -- in perfect makeup, tight tops, lowcut jeans,
            and bellybutton ring -- and resolves that day to get with the cool
            girls. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Initially
            scornful of this corny girl in cutesy blue socks (&quot;Who let her
            out of the cabbage patch?&quot;), Evie relents when Tracy steals a
            wallet full of cash and offers it up as a kind of dowry. From here,
            Tracy reels into a torrent of first times -- getting her tongue and
            navel pierced, shoplifting on Melrose, drinking, tripping on acid.
            And, of course, experimenting with sex -- with boys and with each
            other, high and straight. As they've picked up from every cultural
            sign around them, sex is a route to adulthood, but it's also an
            ordeal, a test of their very young mettle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            girls' almost instantly codependent friendship leads to inevitable
            tension and competition between them, especially when Evie seeks
            Mel's attention, telling stories about abuses at home -- these
            shift, depending on what Evie thinks to say each time: her aunt's
            boyfriend hit her, her father bruised her. While it's never quite
            clear how Evie has been abused or by whom, her situation is plainly
            raucous; she lives with Brooke (Deborah Kara Unger), who, much like
            the girls, pursues mass-marketed happiness, imagining that wearing
            girly outfits, sleeping with younger men, or getting plastic surgery
            will make her happy. The film suggests that she's not, but only from
            a distance, as the girls perceive her, running down the hallway on
            the way to work, or through a window as she huddles on her couch,
            stitched and black-and-blue from her ear job. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Co-written
            by Reed and director Catherine Hardwicke, and inspired by Reed's
            experiences (as she's been telling the many interviewers who
            regularly look pleased to see that she's not only survived, but also
            graduated to a poised movie stardom at age 15), <i>Thirteen</i> is
            both harrowing and moralistic. In this doubled effect, it recalls
            Larry Clark's <i>Kids</i> (1995), exposing bad behavior in handheld
            Super 16 imagery (here the camera is by the endlessly resourceful
            Elliot Davis [<i>Get on the Bus</i>, 1996]), that hovers between
            reportage and sensationalism. Unlike <i>Kids</i> -- and this is a
            crucial difference -- <i>Thirteen</i> offers more than glimpses of
            adults. Though Mel tends to appear from the girls' point of view,
            framed by windows and doorways, not quite understanding what they're
            going through, she manifestly cares about them, means to do well,
            and won't give up on them (&quot;Baby,&quot; she pleads, &quot;We
            have to have a real talk&quot;). Even Brady is a warm, generous guy,
            only walking off (&quot;This place is f*cking with my head&quot;)
            when Tracy knows -- as she does with everyone -- just what buttons
            to push. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            <i>Thirteen</i> comes with a <i>Kids</i>-like rating, that doesn't
            allow thirteen-year-olds to see it; Hardwicke advocates that kids
            see it with adults with whom they can discuss it together. Such
            discussion might be especially helpful when it comes to the movie's
            presentation of Tracy and Evie's sexual experimentations, which
            raise the specter of race-mixing anxieties, as they pursue black and
            Hispanic boys, who impress girls by rapping and beatboxing. Evie
            slips out the window to &quot;party&quot; with some kid in the park,
            leaving Tracy to wonder what she's missing. When Tracy does attract
            the attention of the beautiful and much desired Javi (Charles
            Duckworth), the girls work their simultaneous makeout and blowjob
            sessions in mirror fashion, Tracy copying Evie's actions, step by
            step, from tongue-kissing and straddling to stripping off her top
            and unzipping Javi's jeans. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            Evie later pursues Javi herself, for an evening's distraction, only
            underlines her own insecurity that looks like malice to Tracy. That
            the girls specifically and aggressively seek out sex and drug
            activities with young black men and Latinos speaks to the boys'
            emblematic coolness, but their desire comes with baggage --
            cultural, historical, political -- that Tracy and Evie can't begin
            to fathom. The movie might be clearer about how this works, or
            provide a broader context that doesn't depend on Evie serving as a
            plot device and emblem of dire descent, instigation and model for
            Tracy's bad behaviors.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            <i>Thirteen</i> shifts awkwardly from overstatement to ambiguity
            with regard to Evie and Tracy, it renders Tracy and Mel's
            relationship with affecting detail. In part, this has to do with
            Wood and Hunter, who are frequently stunning (Mel's assault on her
            own kitchen floor tiles is one remarkable moment), but it's also a
            function of the attention paid to both characters' ongoing efforts
            to deal with more or less familiar traumas. So daily are these
            struggles that even the house illustrates their simultaneous lack of
            boundaries and inability to communicate: Tracy's room has windows
            looking out on the living room, where she watches Mel make out with
            Brady. Tracy's discomfort is also visible, and she has no recourse.
            It's as if Mel is doing this to her, on purpose. When you're
            thirteen, increased depth of vision means more layers of you. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Confused,
            loving, and mutually frustrating, mother and daughter lurch from
            moment to moment, desperate to connect even when full-on
            confrontation seems the only route. It's the sort of crisis that
            can't be resolved or even fully rendered in one movie, but <i>Thirteen</i>
            does well to dig into its nuances.<o:p>
