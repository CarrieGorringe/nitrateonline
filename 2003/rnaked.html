            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,
            4 April 2003</i></font>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With a burst 
			of semi-automatic gunfire, the girls at Madame M's school for 
			assassins are roused from their sleep and given one of their final 
			assignments: kill the girl next to them, and drag the body outside 
			as proof! The poor girls don't have much choice: if they don't 
			comply, they'll be shot themselves. This, plus some later 
			shenanigans in a cage, reduce the number of the graduation class, 
			who have spent the last six years being shown and training in the 
			finer aspects of mayhem, from forty to three, and all I could think 
			was, that's an awfully low rate of return.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Naked Weapon</i> 
			has been promoted as being a sequel of sorts to the 1992 Hong Kong 
			thriller <i>Naked Killer</i>, which, even before it arrived in the 
			U.S. around 1995, garnered something of a reputation for its 
			perverse combination of sex and violence. In that film, beautiful 
			young women were running around all over the place knocking off men 
			and doing so with an unusual amount of relish: in one scene, the 
			Hong Kong police find the body of one of their victims, but they 
			can't account for all of the body parts (some of which turn out to 
			be hidden in the draperies). The killer girls are part of a 
			&quot;sisterhood&quot; who have dedicated themselves to their craft, and, in
			<i>Naked Weapon</i> (which was written and produced by Wong Jing, 
			who also wrote and produced <i>Naked Killer</i>), the girls who are 
			taken to a remote island and who make up the last of Madame M's new 
			class of assassins-in-training are introduced to their classmates 
			with, &quot;These are your sisters.&quot; (Which makes turning the girls 
			against each other -- even if it is in line with Madame M's stated 
			objective of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; -- seem even more bizarre.)</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But <i>Naked 
			Weapon</i> doesn't quite have the same loopy quality that gave <i>
			Naked Killer</i> its air of being the <b><i>ne plus ultra</i></b> of 
			what David Denby (in his review of <i>La Femme Nikita</i>) termed 
			&quot;nihilistic mannequin chic&quot;. The new picture is more slick, at least 
			in terms of having higher production values, and a lot more 
			impersonal, particularly in the outrages it attempts to perpetrate 
			-- when the three girls who survive Madame M's course in how to 
			become killing machines are drugged and then have big, burly men 
			force themselves upon them in order to further learn how to become 
			desensitized and use their bodies as &quot;weapons&quot;, it simply seems like 
			an excuse to get a gang-bang scene into the picture -- and, if you 
			can believe it, a rather half-hearted attempt at that. (Despite the 
			violence, the sex and nudity in the film are actually less bad than 
			what you'd see in an average HBO &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; episode.)</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charlene (played 
			by Maggie Q) and Katt (played by Anya) go globetrotting through the 
			major cities of the world wearing stylish outfits and bumping people 
			off -- all of whom are famous or gangsters, the picture informs us, 
			and some of whom are actually identified for us before they bite the 
			dust -- in lethal ways which include the use of stiletto heels and 
			sunglass lenses. Charlene and Katt also make a pact to look out for 
			each other -- they haven't been totally dehumanized! -- which 
			includes a hair-breath escape from a sleazy narcotics king's 
			headquarters in Spain (also one of many instances in the film where 
			the plot giddily unravels into nonsense). The third graduate girl, 
			Jing (played by Jewel Lee), unfortunately proves to be too schitzy 
			to be trustworthy (although if you've been through what these girls 
			have been through for the last six years, you'd probably be a little 
			schitzy, too). When Charlene makes an attempt to visit her mother 
			(Cheng Pei Pei) in Hong Kong, which is a no-no, she crosses paths 
			with C.I.A. agent Jack Chan (Daniel Wu), which is when, an hour in, 
			the movie finally breaks through to the loony level. A Japanese 
			gangster shoots Charlene with a dart filled with an aphrodisiac, and 
			she and Jack end up on a beach, where, as the surf rolls in and out, 
			she says it's alright for him to have sex with her after he hits 
			himself on the head several times trying to stop himself. In the 
			morning, he wakes up and finds a farewell note stuck in his shoe.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Trying for an 
			anything-goes atmosphere, the filmmakers put in such devices as 
			having Jack and Charlene stuck in the back of a refrigerated truck 
			transporting ice cream, pointing guns at each other until it gets 
			too cold to hold their arms up, and the director and action 
			choreographer Tony Ching Siu Tung (whose recently worked on Zhang 
			Yimou's historical action epic <i>Hero</i>) stages some titanic 
			fight scenes, including a climatic one where Charlene visualizes 
			instructing herself, &quot;Let your heart become water&quot;, before massively 
			vanquishing her opponent (done, <i>Matrix</i>-style, with plenty of 
			suspended-second moments where the camera circles around the actors 
			as they perform unreal moves).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film was also 
			made in English, leading to some stunningly stilted exchanges, 
			including one between Jack and Charlene, which occurs while Jack is 
			ferrying Charlene's mother, piggyback, to the hospital (it's just 
			down the road, so they decide not to call for an ambulance): She: 
			&quot;You're a good guy.&quot; He (sounding like an abashed Jack Gyllenhaal): 
			&quot;The last time you said that, you hit me with your gun.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maggie Q, Anya, 
			and Daniel Wu all have previous experience as professional models, 
			so they all look great. The most stunning, though, is the girl who 
			figures in the six-and-a-half minute prologue, sashaying into 
			someone's apartment in Rome while wearing the shortest silver-lame 
			cocktail dress I've ever seen. Alas! it's the last time we see her 
			or the dress -- with the level of extreme action and oft-times 
			punishing soundtrack, it's thwack, thwack, thwack for the rest of 
			the picture.</font></td>
