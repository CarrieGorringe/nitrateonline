            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory

            <p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Girl from Paris</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">,
            an allegedly idyllic film about how a young woman discovers the joys
            of French country life, almost lost me from the get-go when, in the
            first seven minutes, a live farm pig is, noisily, strung up by its
            haunches, shot point-blank in the head, and then drained of its
            blood prior to butchering. It is enough to cause the heroine to
            decide upon raising goats (for milk and cheese) and crops on the
            farm she takes charge to toil upon, but Mathilda Seigner, the
            actress who plays her, doesn't seem too crazy about the experience,
            either. Later, right at about the one-hour mark, we are shown a
            brief sequence of cattle being killed prior to processing. Are the
            filmmakers trying to say something? Not really: the cute bunnies
            that Michel Serrault's character raises are for food, not pets.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><sup>*</sup></b>&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seigner plays a girl who sees a
            sign for the Rhône-Alps on the back of a Paris bus one day and
            decides to chuck it all -- including her job as a computer and
            Internet user instructor -- to take up life as a farmer (For which
            she takes a two-year course, at an agrarian school. You don't mess
            around on these things).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Serrault
            plays a man who's been doing just that for many years and decides to
            sell, but, due to a snag, he can't entirely vacate the place for
            another eighteen months. His initial disdain for her softens, as
            does her decision to chuck farm life and go back to the city and her
            old boyfriend (Frédéric Pierrot, who looks continually baffled, as
            if he can't really believe Seigner has deigned to be in his
            presence).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With few exceptions (see above),
            the filmmakers aim at being both deft and light -- so light, in
            fact, that the film (which was a hit in France, under the title <b><i>Une
            hirondelle a fait le printemps</i></b>, or, <i>One Swallow Came
            Before Spring</i>) turns positively drowsy in parts. There are
            pointed comparisons between the advantages of getting back in touch
            with the land and Our Modern Age, with people plugged into cell
            phones and headsets that create barriers between interaction with
            nature and with other people. There are also some predictable story
            devices, such as one that has us think that one of the characters
            has died but it turns out that we guessed wrong all the time.
            Seigner's character really seems to like leading her goatherd
            (&quot;Allez, Mouchette!&quot;) to and from pasture every day -- the
            gorgeous gold-and-green views of actual Rhône-Alps landscapes by
            cinematographer Antoine Héberlé provide us with a good idea why.
            I'd like to see what happens when she's stuck out there for a good
            three months after the first really big snowfall, though.</font></p>
