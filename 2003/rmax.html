            1918. What if 30-year-old Adolf Hitler, suffering, like the rest of
            post World War I Germany, under the economical-social-political
            defeatist weight of the Treaty of Versailles, actually nurtured his
            fascistic artistic inclinations instead of adopting the infant
            political ideology of National Socialism as his new art form. Even
            the Jews were ashamed to be German when this document was signed.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oscar-nominated
            screenwriter Menno Meyjes (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Color Purple</i>, plus <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Indiana

            of the Sun</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Siege</i>)
            has sat down in the director's hot seat for the first time with what
            is sure to be one of the most discussed films of the year-end
            season, and then some. Fashioning such a serious film around one of
            history's most despicable rulers will guarantee an aura of
            controversy not seen since then 95-year-old Leni Riefenstahl, the
            filmmaker responsible for the quintessential, powerful Third Reich
            documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Triumph of the
            Will</i> and a close friend of Hitler, was honored with a
            life-achievement award at the 1997 Cinecon, a extended L.A.-based
            Labor Day Weekend gathering of film buffs who celebrate film history
            with screenings and personal appearances.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            sensible people today don't envision Adolf Hitler as a human being
            at all. He's barely one in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Max</i>.
            Meyjes has crafted a fictionalized account of a social outcaste that
            is far from sentimental, as depicted by Noah Taylor (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shine</i>).
            The director-writer actually has sketched out what passes for
            revisionist history, albeit one with the same tragic outcome.
            Taylor, the actor, disappears within the role of a sniffling
            Corporal Hitler, becoming such an incredibly troubled creature and
            allowing himself to wander across an emotional minefield that will
            have audiences transfixed, outraged and shell-shocked. Taylor's
            gaunt, tattered appearance and pre-Satanic interpretation (Hitler
            doesn't smoke, drink—alcoholic or coffee, or eat meat) will
            undoubtedly earn him horrifying glances on the street and accolades
            from his peers.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Taylor's
            embodiment of the tortured psyche of Germany's future Führer as a
            disoriented, starving artist begins with his search for income and
            inspiration, and quickly finds him the unlikely, yet distant,
            acquaintance of art dealer Max Rothman (John Cusack). The urban,
            sophisticated German-Jew helps the homeless soldier with food,
            lodging, and the nurturing of an attentive mentor, perhaps trying to
            elicit such artwork that Rothman is no longer capable of creating,
            having lost his drawing arm in the war. The film follows the mental
            blood-poisoning of both student and teacher. Their relationship,
            barely friendly, is followed by a grudgingly fluid camera and
            desolate score. Rothman has his own financial, physical, and
            emotional insecurities. Strong-willed wife (Molly Parker), children,
            and wealthy in-laws at home; beautiful, envious mistress (Leelee
            Sobieski as Liselore Von Peltz) on the side; and business in the
            toilet.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cusack,
            also an associate producer, has crafted one of his boldest
            performances as the chain-smoking Rothman. Admired for his darkly
            comic characters (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Being John Malkovich</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Grosse
            Pointe Blank</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Grifters</i>),
            his performance here does have at least one bleakly funny moment, in
            which he has an interesting conversation about tapeworms and the
            weather while dining with his wife and her slightly ditsy parents.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not to
            give you the wrong impression, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Max</i>
            is a real tongue-depressor. It'll make you gag. The film is
            definitely an unsympathetic mood piece about the post-war malaise.
            Impoverished soldiers back from the front call up their Aryan
            strength at the beckoning of the persuasive Captain Mayr (Ulrich
            Thomsen), who instills in his vulnerable men some good,
            old-fashioned anti-Semitism to focus their attention away from the
            hard times. Hitler is the hardest convert (&quot;I don't believe in
            emotive anti-Semitism&quot;), whose principles on the subject are
            based on fact. Its broader implications ought to be in the hands of
            the government, he continues, &quot;like public health or
            sewage.&quot; The purity of the races and the hatred of the Jews
            become flash points for Hitler (and datively, for Rothman),
            particularly at a degrading puppet show authorized by Mayr that
            indoctrinates these beliefs to his men, who laugh at an Aryan rape
            as if a group of amused, obedient kindergartners.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lajos
            Koltai is primarily responsible for film's decidedly drab, muddy
            tone. As the director of photography of the much brighter <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Emperor's Club</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sunshine</i>,
            his work more closely resembles that which he orchestrated on
            Giuseppe Tornatore's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Legend of 1900</i>, a compelling, ship-bound tale of a man and his
            piano. The cold-to-the-touch production work of Ben Van Os (Peter
            Greenaway's oft-used designer), especially the vast, leaking former
            ironworks that now houses Rothman's low-rent gallery, and the sparse
            score by Dan Jones, are equally impressive.</font></p>
