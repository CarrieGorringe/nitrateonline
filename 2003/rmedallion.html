            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 22 August 2003</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't mind having Jackie Chan
            repeat himself. There is an undeniable joy about watching him turn
            ordinary objects like mantle pieces, fruit and ladders into weapons.
            As long as the objects and settings are different with every film,
            it's a formula that can be repeated without inducing boredom. The
            problem with <i>The Medallion</i> is that it's too much like <i>The
            Tuxedo</i> -- an American Jackie movie so wretched that Chan
            reportedly slammed it during the press junkets -- and not enough
            like <i>Supercop </i>(a.k.a <i>Police Story III</i>), <i>Operation
            Condor</i> (a.k.a. <i>Armor of God II</i>) or even <i>Shanghai Noon</i>.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Chan's better movies, the thrill
            of watching them is that he and the stuntmen opponents seem to find
            endless ways to punch and dodge each other while the camera rarely
            moves. The wow factor came from the fact that Chan and his crew
            appeared to be riffing with the principles of physics without the
            benefit of optical or digital effects. In many cases, they really
            could move like you saw on the screen. In the latest one, though,
            age (Chan is nearly fifty) and a &quot;computer generated images can
            save everything&quot; attitude negates any excitement.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chan plays Eddie Yang, a capable
            Hong Kong cop who has been teemed with an obnoxiously pedantic
            British Interpol Agent named Watson (Lee Evans, <i>There's Something
            About Mary</i>). The two are after a mysterious fellow (possibly
            because of poor character development) named Snakehead (Julian
            Sands), who seems up to no good in Eddie's turf. Snakehead isn't
            after conventional contraband. He kidnaps a small boy who carries a
            rare medallion that can bring the dead back to life and even give
            them supernatural powers. Eddie and Watson manage to trace Snakehead
            to his Irish lair and even hook up with Eddie's ex Nicole (Claire
            Forlani), who conveniently happens to be another Interpol agent.
            Eddie rescues the lad but dies in the process, so now viewers get an
            excuse to see Jackie do what he does best.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Except that he really doesn't.
            Although Chan's nearly lifelong friend and collaborator Sammo Hung
            is credited with directing the fight sequences, the human action is
            staged indifferently. One of the more interesting sequences actually
            happens before Eddie is resurrected. Chan manages to climb over
            fences and subdue an antagonist using trashcans.When Chan is leaping
            around before <i>and</i> after his onscreen death, there really
            isn't much of a change. As a result, <i>The Medallion </i>gets
            monotonous. Even Jim Carrey toned down his manic side for the human
            scenes in <i>The Mask</i>. It doesn't help that Chan has an
            oil-and-water chemistry with his costars. Evans seems to be acting
            (or mugging) his way around Chan instead of with him. Forlani isn't
            asked to do much, but at least she looks good in a leather outfit
            and credible when she throws punches.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chan is much more fun with he's
            paired with someone like Owen Wilson (the <i>Shanghai</i> movies) or
            Michelle Yeoh (<i>Supercop</i>). The former can so likeably goofy
            that he becomes Chan's Caucasian brother, and the latter's stern
            efficiency complements Chan's clowning nicely. It's best to check
            him out in these pairings and just to leave <i>The Medallion </i>hanging.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
