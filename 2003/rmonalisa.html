            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Yes, they did have diaphragms in
            the 1950s. They were still jitterbugging as late as 1954 (Bill Haley
            and the Comets doing &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was still a
            year or so away). And, for a lot of women, the standard was to get
            married, raise children, and look after the home -- people could
            afford to do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
            don't think a Wellesley College student would have been allowed to
            openly attack a faculty member in the school newspaper without
            receiving censure for being importune or just plain rude.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which is probably why Ginnifer
            Goodwin's character is the most affecting part of <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i>.
            She plays Connie, a Wellesley student who, at a formal dance, meets
            Charlie Stewart (Ebon Moss-Bacharach), a guy whom she thinks her
            friends have set-up to be her date for the evening. When she finds
            out that this is not so -- that the reason he's being nice and wants
            to be around her is because he likes her for who she is -- you can
            see how this genuinely moves her. Connie is not unattractive, but
            she looks like the kind of girl who, if this type of opportunity
            with this type of guy comes along, it may only happen once, and she
            knows it. Goodwin steals the movie away from some considerable
            competition -- three of her character's classmates and friends are
            played by Julia Stiles (struggling, unsuccessfully,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>not to sound overly mannered), Kirsten Dunst (projecting the
            tungsten-steel beauty of a young East Coast WASP), and Maggie
            Gyllenhaal (brilliant in last year's <i>Secretary</i>, and here
            taking on a great, Suzanne Pleshette-like swagger and grace), and
            they all take an Art History class from a new teacher played by
            Julia Roberts.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;All of her life, she wanted
            to teach at Wellesley College,&quot; says the narration when
            Roberts' Katharine Roberts arrives from California (the story is set
            on the cusp of the jet age, when the West Coast still truly seemed
            like a foreign country to the East), and in one of the opening
            scenes, she leads her class through a slide presentation during
            which they identify all of the artwork before she has a chance to
            talk about them, making her feel like a rube in the process. The
            film gets the look and feel of the circumspect Fifties New England
            life (I've BEEN in houses like some of the ones in this picture)
            right down to the chintz used to decorate the room Katharine rents
            from Nancy, who, as played by Marcia Gay Harden, has a quiet,
            ingenuous poise and looks like she may be something of a pistol in
            disguise when she identifies one of the female faculty members as
            having had a &quot;companion&quot; who just passed away, without
            sounding disapproving. But Harden's character turns into nothing
            more than a couch potato meant to be as bland and complacent as the
            TV quiz shows she watches at home. Katharine encourages Stiles'
            character to follow up her pre-law studies by applying to Yale,
            rather than vanish into a planned marriage, and introduces her class
            to modern abstract art, thus causing the faculty to reconsider
            whether she should stay at the school or not.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is Katharine supposed to be a
            &quot;progressive thinker,&quot; and, if so, where did she get her
            ideas from? If she had parents who got turned on to liberalism in
            the 1930s -- an obvious possibility -- it's never mentioned, and a
            lot of the movie feels like some of the glue that would hold things
            together was taken out. (For instance, abstract art in the Fifties
            was often equated with intellectualism, intellectualism with
            subversiveness, and subversiveness with Communism.) Katharine isn't
            even given a scene, let alone a chance, to argue in her own defense
            before her detractors, and taking her class to see one Jackson
            Pollock canvas would hardly qualify, now, as being some sort of
            danger. Katharine is also shown dumping her perfectly well-meaning
            West Coast boyfriend (John Slattery) in favor of the school's
            Italian teacher, played by Dominic West, who turns around and tells
            her, &quot;You think you came to Wellesley to help the girls find
            their way. I think you came to help the girls find your way.&quot;
            This would suggest a kind of conformity that's no improvement over
            the commercial-ad style of life that Katharine, and the movie,
            express disapproval of, but this also comes from a guy who not only
            admits that he hasn't been honest about himself or his past, but who
            is openly known among the student body for sleeping with his
            students.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the reasons the movie goes
            all soft is because this is another role that Julia Roberts
            intelligently, thoughtfully, and conscientiously navigates her way
            through while very, very, very quietly displaying her screen charm.
            Heaven knows she's reached for subtlety in the past, sometimes with
            success, often at the expense of becoming amorphous. The title
            refers not to Roberts' grin, but to a woman who smiles without
            giving any particular reason for feeling happy. Without giving its
            main character the chance to stand by the courage of her
            convictions, the movie pretends to be about the joys of
            enlightenment and emancipation, but instead short circuits itself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>and totally defeats its own purposes. Which is why Ginnifer
            Goodwin's storyline -- a girl who is accepted by a decent guy for
            her own worth -- is the most affecting thing in the movie. She's
            probably going to be the one who'll turn around and lead a radical
            movement for positive change in the 1960s. Katharine will be in
            Europe, sipping espresso.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
