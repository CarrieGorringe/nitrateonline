            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The
            first few minutes of <i>The Hard Word</i> look like lots of convict
            movies. A squad of tough prisoners are balling in slow motion,
            chain-link fence framing and a handheld camera evoking a slightly
            grainy Nike commercial. A hard guitar track thrums in the
            background, a fight breaks out, guards blows whistles and pull out
            their bats. Eventually, the camera makes its way to another convict,
            grim-faced and calculating, observing the melee from the library,
            where he shelves books. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            would be Dale (a scruffed-up Guy Pearce), eldest of the Twentyman
            brothers. It so happens that hotheaded Shane (Joel Edgerton) and
            sweet-natured Mal (Damien Richardson) are doing time at the same
            prison, for armed robbery. Bored inside -- there's only so much
            enlightenment Dale can glean from multiple readings of the Bible and
            <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> -- the team is just waiting for the next
            gig. Arranged by their ultrashady lawyer, Frank (Robert Taylor),
            it's right up their alley, armored truck robbery. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Job-wise,
            the brothers are aces: Dale plans all moves to the last fraction of
            a second, and all adhere to the primary injunction, that no one gets
            hurt. Personal-lives-wise, they're slightly less assured: Shane's a
            little psychotic (both evidenced and undermined as he seduces his
            extremely willing prison shrink [Rhondda Findleton]); Mal's more
            inclined to butchering, as was their father's business, than toward
            scaring and stealing from people; and Dale's fetching,
            bleached-blond wife Carol (Rachel Griffiths) is screwing Frank.
            While it's obvious enough that this has been going on for some time,
            Dale seems disturbed to spot it (as the brothers are carted off for
            the armored vehicle job, he notes Frank lighting wifey's cigarette:
            cue sign of suspicion, that is, the frame lingers on Dale's dour
            face through car window). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            the robbery goes off well, Frank scuttles the brothers' intended
            escape, and instead has them picked up on non-existent charges and
            sent back to prison, where they stew and grumble. When Carol comes
            to visit Dale, she performs as a typical seductress, smearing her
            &quot;I want you, baby&quot; heat on the window between them, even
            making a smiley face of it. Dale, however, is having none of this
            come-on, fixated on the possibility that she's cheating; their
            reflections show through one another throughout the
            shot-reverse-shotting of their conversation, indicating mutual
            duplicity. They're so used to using one another and anyone else who
            gets in their way, they can't imagine another sort of involvement.
            She denies any wrongdoing, and he can't decide whether he wants to
            believe her. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            the wanting that drives everyone's interactions in <i>The Hard Word</i>.
            No one is capable of generosity or trust: they all know too much.
            Figuring that he has to get out in order to find out Dale threatens
            Frank until the lawyer comes up with a scheme to finish off this
            increasing headache once and for all (Frank seems to believe that
            Carol's devotion to him, or at least his money, is for real). This
            involves stealing the betting monies at The Melbourne Cup,
            accompanied by a fourth man, the plainly dangerous Tarzan (Dorian
            Nikona), also the only black man in sight. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            standard caper movie, <i>The Hard Word</i> is less interested in
            plotty hijinks or even clever editing and zap-pans than it is in
            characters, to the point of near-abstraction. This makes them
            difficult as points of identification. Writer-director Scott Roberts
            says his conception of the brothers was inspired by the familial
            relations of TV's <i>Bonanza</i>: each has a specific role,
            established, more or less, by his temperament &quot;Dale is the
            smart one,&quot; says Shane, &quot;Mal's the good one, and I'm the
            f*ck-up&quot;). Shane's matinee-idol-style looks hardly make up for
            his often ugly immaturity; Mal's pleasantness is tempered by his
            capacity for cruelty when called for; and Dale's jutty-jawed resolve
            is complicated by Pearce's nervy performance, his glowering and
            agitated refusal to give in to viewer desires for
            leading-mannishness. He can be pretty, certainly, but here he's
            muddled his diction and bruised his eyes, so that Dale remains
            distant, taciturn and grumpy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His
            anger may be well disciplined or well repressed, and it might even
            be genuine. Aside from his deathless loyalty to his brothers, Dale
            doesn't have much investment in any of his relationships or his
            endeavors, aside from a vaguely macho desire to beat the system, the
            way <i>noir</i> heroes like to do. This loyalty throws something of
            a wrench into his relationship with Carol, as the boys -- whose
            experience with girls ranges from a nipple-suckling sort of
            womanizing (Shane) to none at all (Mal), tend to think she's up to
            something, specifically, that she'll throw them all over for cash
            money. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Dale and Carol's relationship becomes increasingly vexed, the film
            grants you access to scenes he can't know about, as when she puts
            off the slimy Frank. Perhaps she's having second thoughts (he's <i>so</i>
            sludgy), but then again, maybe it's part of a broader plan, either
            on her part or Dale's. Carol appears at first to embody trouble of
            the femme fatale-ish variety, but she's eventually messier than this
            stereotype suggests, at once ambitious, resolute, and visibly
            uncertain. This makes her nearly as opaque as her man, which means
            that their serial betrayals, while predictable in a convict movie,
            also don't occur precisely when or how you'd expect. </font><o:p>
