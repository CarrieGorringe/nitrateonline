            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>David Cronenberg’s fascination
            with the imprecise line between fantasy and reality takes mature
            form with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Spider</i>, a mesmerizing adaptation of Patrick McGrath’s novel that
            stands as the director’s most accomplished work to date. A
            riveting examination of the human mind’s capacity for denial (and
            the dire ramifications of such coping mechanisms), the film marks an
            apparent turning point for the director, reimagining his trademark
            fixations – generally slimy creatures either penetrating or
            escaping from their human body hosts – without the usual gory
            science fiction or horror trappings. Here, Cronenberg’s
            penetration obsession comes via Dennis “Spider” Cleg (Ralph
            Fiennes), a mentally ill gentleman whose scarred psyche becomes
            fertile soil for both a murder mystery and an investigation into the
            delusional machinations of the schizophrenic mind.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cleg, nicknamed Spider because of
            his adolescent attraction to Mom’s tales of spider webs (and also,
            perhaps, because of his fractured state of mind), has just been
            released from a mental hospital into the care of a halfway house
            located in the London neighborhood where he grew up. The film opens
            with a long tracking shot past passengers departing a train, finally
            settling on the disheveled and tentative Spider, whose cautious
            steps onto the station platform immediately reveal him to be a
            disturbed individual. Mumbling indecipherable gibberish under his
            breath, Spider shuffles his way through London’s surreally drab,
            empty streets – the “normal” people we’ve seen departing the
            train are the last this film will concern itself with – and into
            the grim halfway household of Mrs. Wilkenson (Lynn Redgrave).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a brief encounter with a
            fellow inmate named Terrence (John Neville) – whose question to
            Spider about whether he’s ever been to Africa (the “dark
            continent”), is loaded with metaphorical significance – Spider
            retires to his dingy room, hiding his suitcase full of assorted
            trinkets under his bed and his precious notepad under the dusty
            floor rug. Since there’s little supervision of the house’s
            residents, Spider begins to wander the streets of his old
            neighborhood, and his return to assorted childhood haunts bring back
            visions of his nightmarish 1960’s youth spent in the care of his
            loving, attentive housewife mom (Miranda Richardson) and drunken,
            abusive plumber dad (Gabriel Byrne). The adult Spider cowers in the
            background as his memories play out in front of his eyes, and the
            film effortlessly crosscuts between these flashbacks and the
            present, which usually involves Spider furiously recording his
            thoughts in his notepad while locked away in his bedroom. Like the
            desolate London streets outside his window, this room – which will
            soon be overrun by intertwining string, organized in a web-like
            pattern, along its ceiling – becomes a visual representation of
            Spider’s lonely, anguished mental condition. Returning home has
            sent him spiraling down a cancerous memory lane, ensnaring him in a
            sticky web of childhood horrors too terrible to honestly confront
            and too devastating to overcome.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spider’s childhood was a fairly
            volatile one, with Dad spending most of his nights at the local pub
            and Mom working tirelessly to maintain a proper house and care for
            her growing child without incurring the wrath of her oft-belligerent
            husband. Dear old Dad frequently visited a randy blond tart – a
            woman with decaying teeth and a penchant for obnoxious braying (also
            played by Richardson) who looked strikingly similar to Spider’s
            mother – and the two eventually knocked off Spider’s mom and set
            up house together. When Spider went to wake his parents the morning
            after his mother’s murder, he was shocked to discover his beloved
            mum replaced by a garish tramp who, in the days and weeks that
            followed, treated the boy with nothing but indifferent contempt.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But as the adult Spider’s
            recollections of these seminal events become more and more bizarre
            – how, for example, can Spider remember events that he was not a
            witness to? –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
            veracity of his, and consequently the film’s, narrative is called
            into question. What we can glean from his untrustworthy
            remembrances, however, is the possible origin of his madness: the
            seemingly innocent but nonetheless traumatic discovery of his mother
            trying on a fashionable negligee. Her inappropriate question to
            Spider –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“You think
            Dad will like it?” – awakens his latent Oedipal desires, and
            heralds the psychological death knell for the fragile young boy.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Cronenberg’s trippy
            cinematic reworking of William S. Burroughs’ <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Naked
            Lunch</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spider</i> is a
            purely subjective experience that abandons conventional logic for
            the delirious psychosis of its increasingly deranged protagonist.
            The director uses a variety of skewed angles, long shots, ominously
            rhythmic editing, and cramped framing (including a gorgeously
            melancholy shot of Spider and Terrence eating breakfast through a
            doorway) to give the film its air of clinical detachment. These
            distancing techniques not only allow us to observe Spider as
            outsiders (despite being “inside” his mind), but also augment
            the sense of alienated desperation that consumes Spider’s life.
            Cronenberg, working with Luc Besson’s long-time cinematographer
            Peter Suschitzky, has shot a film of bleak, stifling melancholy that
            pulsates with subliminal malevolence.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the reclusive, tortured Spider,
            Ralph Fiennes admirably avoids the pitfalls inherent in embodying a
            mentally handicapped character (twitchy mannerisms, goofy voices,
            bursts of comic or uplifting lunacy) by using a downcast glare and
            shambling edginess to craft a haunting portrait of a man whose life
            has been torn apart from the inside out. But the prize catch of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spider</i>’s
            web is Miranda Richardson, whose portrayal of Spider’s good and
            bad mothers (not to mention a third maternal figure) exhibits the
            kind of awe-inspiring range – freely alternating between nurturing
            affection and coiled rage – that greatness is made of. Spider may
            be unsure of whether his mother was a saint or a whore, but
            there’s no denying that Richardson’s magnificent triple-threat
            performance is the stuff memories are made of.</font></p>
