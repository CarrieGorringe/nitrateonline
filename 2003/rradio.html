            <i>Radio</i>, James Robert Kennedy, nicknamed Radio (Cuba Gooding,
            Jr.), pulses with the innocence, energy, and, often, the charm of a
            child. That is, he is mentally challenged but also indomitable, and
            so, in the tradition of mainstream movies of this type (especially
            those with the dreaded designation, &quot;based on a true
            story&quot;), he has much to &quot;teach&quot; those around him.
            That means you.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this case, Radio lives in a small town, Anderson, South Carolina, in
            1976. Here he pushes a shopping cart along railroad tracks, filling
            it with treasures he finds. One day, the film suggests, he pushes
            his cart near the local high school's football practice, where he
            attracts the attention of a few of the team's rowdy, supercilious
            boys. As Radio is harmless and sweet, they decide to tie him up and
            lock him in a shed, whereupon they throw rocks and balls against the
            walls to torment him, just to hear hum scream in terror.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            happens that the football coach (and math teacher), Harold Jones (Ed
            Harris, whose understated performance far outdistances the script),
            sees this assault and intervenes, cutting Radio loose so he can run
            in a panic across the field, and punishing the boys with extra hours
            of drills the next day. Feeling guilty that his boys have behaved so
            badly and struck by Radio's apparent interest in the game that he
            loves so much, Coach invites the young man to come by the field
            again, whereupon he offers him an unpaid job, serving the boys who
            have so badly abused him. This will help the boys to be better
            people, Coach reasons. He also gives Radio a hamburger and a radio,
            because he really likes radios. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back
            home, Mrs. Jones, Linda (Debra Winger, who needs more time on
            screen, as she consistently provides welcome respite from the film's
            immense corniness), wonders what her husband is up to. This because,
            during football season, Harold doesn't make time for his own teenage
            daughter, Mary Helen (Sarah Drew), and because the players' parents
            start calling to complain about that one afternoon's worth of
            drills. &quot;You didn't see the look on this young man's face,
            Linda,&quot; Coach says by way of explanation. &quot;He was
            terrified.&quot; Linda appreciates this, because she's a supportive
            wife whose appearances are limited to the kitchen, dining room, and
            football bleachers, but she infers other reasons for Harold's
            investment (avoiding his own family, for instance).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two
            other women also offer perspectives beyond Harold's own. Radio's
            hardworking mother, Maggie (S. Epatha Merkerson), is appropriately
            suspicious of the white man's intentions regarding her son. A widow
            and a nurse, she asks her son whether Coach has done anything to
            make him uncomfortable, then, satisfied that James likes his new
            mentor, she puts it to Coach that he look out for her son: &quot;He
            got himself a good heart,&quot; she observes, cautioning Coach not
            to exploit it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along
            the same lines, Principal Daniels (Alfre Woodard) worries that Coach
            (or perhaps the kids who have come to like him) is using Radio
            &quot;as a glorified mascot,&quot; then yields to Coach's passionate
            commitment, at least until he invites Radio to come to school, so he
            can sit in on classes and be tutored after hours. She's especially
            up against it when a school board rep suggests it's unsafe to have
            &quot;a severely retarded man&quot; wandering the hallways: it's her
            job at stake if something untoward occurs, to Radio or anyone else.
            At this point, Daniels just has to ask, &quot;Why on earth are you
            doing this?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why,
            indeed. Inspired by a 1996 <i>Sports Illustrated</i> article by Gary
            Smith, written by Mike Rich (<i>Finding Forrester</i>), and directed
            by Michael Tollin (<i>Summer Catch</i>), <i>Radio</i> spends some
            time excavating the reasons for Coach's investment in saving Radio.
            As in <i>Finding Forrester</i> or <i>Hardball</i> (which Tollin
            produced), the white father-black son relationship is initiated by
            the white man's need for redemption. Predictably, Coach's need is
            born of his own secret trauma, and predictably, he becomes a
            &quot;better person&quot; (coach, teacher, husband, and father) for
            knowing Radio. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Less
            predictably, and more troublingly, the film works hard to erase any
            semblance of culturally sanctioned or institutionalized racism from
            its own project. This is achieved in part by including among Radio's
            tormenters a (preemptively cast?) black player who speaks two or
            three lines, but more emphatically, by assigning major villainy to
            two white characters who remain blithely unaware of their privilege:
            the arrogant quarterback and basketball star Johnny (Riley Smith),
            and his father, prominent banker and team booster Frank (Chris
            Mulkey). During the several post-game, kibbitzy sit-downs that take
            place in the local barbershop (all older white men here), Frank
            becomes increasingly agitated by Radio's participation in team
            activities, and his sideline enthusiasm: &quot;You got yourself a
            distraction that needs dealing with,&quot; he scolds the coach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frank's
            attitude, of course, runs counter to the film's general ethos,
            namely, he's a mean and selfish cur who fears that his son's career
            is threatened by Coach's attention to and accommodation of Radio.
            The film doesn't make a case that Frank sees this threat in terms of
            race difference, but even if it is a function of class and handicap
            prejudice (the Principal seems the only black character residing on
            the white folks' side of the &quot;tracks&quot;), the absence of
            even a mention of race is odd, to say the least. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film is punctuated by scenes where Radio's blackness appears
            significant, not least being the initial assault; the form it takes
            is surely alarming). In still another instance, Radio is
            distributing his Christmas presents (received because the white
            folks have come to like him so much) to the other poor black folks.
            As he pushes his shopping cart from doorstep to doorstep, a newbie
            cop in town comes by and imagines the donut-maker and other such
            products are stolen, slamming Radio up against his cruiser, cuffing
            him, and riding him downtown (as much as the town has a downtown).
            Here the rookie is roundly chastised, but the image of that arrest
            lingers: just walking around with merchandise in his cart, in his
            own neighborhood, Radio looks &quot;guilty&quot; in a small Southern
            town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">More
            strangely -- and far more troublingly -- several characters in the
            film make mention of Radio's older, &quot;normal&quot; brother
            Walter, reportedly away at school. But he never appears, even during
            a time of crisis in Radio's household. Perhaps his actual presence
            -- a black man with a perspective from outside the town -- would
            detract from the white folks' learning curve, being as how he's so
            &quot;close&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; and all. And they, the
            local men anyway, are on a steep one: even the bighearted Coach has
            lived in town all his life, meaning that he doesn't have huge range
            of experience beyond its borders. In any event, this crucial
            omission allows Coach to play noble guide, while also being guided,
            and also allows his fellow citizens to struggle with various levels
            of unstated prejudice. How nice for them. <o:p>
