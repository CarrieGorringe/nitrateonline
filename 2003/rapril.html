            around the quintessential American holiday of Thanksgiving. Although
            I admire the meal he serves up, I left just over half full, perhaps
            feeling like I've been at this table before; plenty of dressing, but
            not enough bread and butter in the back story, for getting behind
            the characters' current state of conflict. Still, you won't leave
            feeling cheated out of a good, decent serving of slices of offbeat
            comedy topped with distinct personalities.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fourth Thursday in November has
            been the subject of similar cinematic misfortune and family mayhem
            for a flock of black sheep, among them Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter)
            in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Home for the Holidays</i>
            (1995), a diverse cultural blend of families in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">What's Cooking?</i> (2000), and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Myth of Fingerprints</i> (1997), Bart Freundlich's darkly comic
            meditation on the subject. In this year's independent, washed-out
            digital-video edition we have Katie Holmes as the titular April
            Burns, the cast off offspring of Jim and Joy (Oliver Platt and
            Patricia Clarkson). Holmes, which my younger readers remember as
            Joey on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dawson's Creek</i>,
            but who the rest of us older folk recall from her capable supporting
            film roles in a dozen or so films, including her debut in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Ice Storm</i> and the more recent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Wonder Boys</i> (two films having thematic similarities to her new
            effort) is the film's centerpiece. Clarkson, fresh from her
            marvelous contribution in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Station Agent</i>, as a grieving mother who finds spiritual support
            in the hands of a dwarf who likes trains and a chatty hot dog
            vendor, again provides a strong, understated performance that
            confirms why so many critics are calling her the queen of the
            indies. Just knowing she's in a film is enough for me to want to
            watch it.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The twist this November holiday go
            round is that the family is reluctantly ripping itself away from its
            cushiony, middle-class suburban roots, piling in their station
            wagon, and trudging en masse to reunite with their out-of-touch and
            ill-equipped-for-the-feast daughter. Mom, diagnosed with a generally
            unspoken of, but obviously terminal case of cancer; dad a.k.a.
            referee of the forced reconciliation; April's &quot;perfect&quot;
            sister Beth (Alison Pill); youngest sibling Timmy (John Gallagher,
            Jr.), constantly photographing the family's emotionally awkward
            outbursts; and ditsy-bordering-on-senile grandmother (Alice
            Drummond), inch toward Manhattan's Lower East Side and assume the
            worst will greet them at the tenement door. On more than one
            occasion, there are self-inflicted attempts to turn the car around
            and crawl back home, like a dog with its tail between its legs. At
            one point, they break they bury, and eulogize, an animal they met in
            the middle of the road. Apparently the Burnses stock up on enough
            Krispy Kreme donuts to struggle onward with their frustrated road
            trip.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, April's propping up her
            holiday trimmings on a wobbly table in a run-down apartment on the
            wrong side of town. She's coping with disastrous holiday
            preparations, particularly a big, naked bird in search of a working,
            and available, oven—she's no competition for Martha Stewart. She's
            anxious, too, wondering how a girl with black polished nails,
            tattooed cherries on her neck, a questionable socioeconomic
            condition, and a black boyfriend, Bobby (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Antwone
            Fisher</i>'s Derek Luke), who has his own subplot to deal with, is
            going to win over a family that, from all appearances, has no
            particular desire to want her back.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The feature thus unfolds from two
            sides on a singular long day, cross-cutting to-and-fro as the meal,
            its disastrous preparation, and its participants (family and April's
            often peculiar and generally helpful neighbors) draw close.
            Ultimately, the push me–pull me attempts from the somewhat
            eccentric sides—particularly mother, on the edge of frailty, and
            April, still bitter—to come to an affecting compromise exhibits
            both uneasy comic moments and emotionally poignant scenes.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The supporting cast handles its
            characters fine, with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Will &amp; Grace</i>'s Sean Hayes plays a dementedly prim upstairs
            tenant who briefly holds April's slow-cooking turkey hostage after
            his feelings are hurt.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The directorial debut of Hedges,
            writer of the novel and screenplay <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What's
            Eating Gilbert Grape?</i> and the Oscar-nominated script <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">About
            a Boy</i>, is an earnest, low-budget effort, seasoned by Hedges' own
            family tragedy, about reconnecting with parents and children broken
            apart by time and an urgent, perhaps doomed, effort to mend wounds
            that have festered over a lifetime. Maybe the result is just another
            quirky film, cute and warm and familiar, but it's a decent enough
            carving of actual family strife to know you're getting the right
            stuffing on the table.<o:p>
