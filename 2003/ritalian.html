            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            30 May 2003</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Mark Wahlberg
            admits that he gets car sick easily, but putting him behind the
            wheel of a suped up MINI Cooper as debonair ex-con master-thief
            Charlie Croker in this flashy, global expansion of the 1969 British
            caper film makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Italian
            Job</i> not at all unsettling for the rest of us. He's not quite
            Cary Grant, be he's in the ballpark.(OK, Cary's at home plate and
            Mark's out in left field.) And Mark, what's with all these remakes
            -- <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Planet of the Apes</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Truth About Charlie</i>, and now <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Italian Job</i>? As for us guys, watching the glamorous Charlize
            Theron in the driver's seat of another tiny companion car (of a trio
            that patriotically engulfs the film in a series of wild rides) has a
            way of easing anyone's queasiness. So what if the film isn't
            entirely believable! It works, in a fast and fleeting manner,
            despite a lite script, thanks to director F. Gary Gray's brisk,
            streamlined direction, the nearly non-stop chase sequences, and
            half-dozen likable, if somewhat eccentric, &quot;bad&quot; guys
            turned vengefully determined scoundrels who are playing a concise,
            clever game of sixupmanship against one of their own who has gone
            over to his dark side.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. Nasty is none
            other than Edward Norton, whose cold-hearted Steve Frezelli bears a
            strikingly close resemblance to Jack Teller, the aggressive, greedy
            character he played in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Score</i>, i.e. a backstabber (in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Italian Job</i> he's a straight-shooter) who deserves, and
            ultimately gets, an elongated payback. While the film is an
            eye-popping diversion, the laser-guided writing by Donna and Wayne
            Powers doesn't approach the charm or sophistication of Ted Griffin's
            2001 remake of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ocean's Eleven</i>.
            For comparison purposes, let's call the new heist film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ocean's
            Lite</i>.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the original
            late-'60s edition was released, I was just starting my freshman year
            at college. I missed it back then in deference to other, more
            scholarly, priorities; it still remains unseen by this reviewer.
            FYI, Wahlberg filled Michael Caine's shoes, when Wahlberg wasn't yet
            a sparkle in his parents' eyes, let alone recording artist Marky
            Mark or a Calvin Klein underwear model. Donald Sutherland (vs.
            playwright/actor Noel Coward in the earlier film) is featured, too
            briefly, as safecracker John Bridger, a charming codger who has
            spent too many years in prison and not enough time with his
            now-grown daughter Stella (Theron), a professional, and honest,
            safe-and-bolt technician living in Philadelphia.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like any good
            action film, the derring-doing starts from a sparkling get go. The
            boys are in the midst of a Venetian &quot;holiday,&quot; where mere
            trinkets won't do for vacation memories. The snappy,
            drumbeat-intense score (John Powell) and wall/ceiling/floor-defying
            cinematography (Wally Pfister) bombard us with pinpoint precise
            information from a fly-on-the-wall p.o.v. Toss in some occasional
            light-hearted dialogue, a few amusing decoys, and quicker than you
            can say <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">polizia</i> </b>the gang has absconded with $35 million in gold bars.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, a
            very profitable day at the office turns into a fatal pink slip for
            John. While the group celebrates amongst the picturesque Austrian
            Alps, Steve pulls his deadly double-cross, leaving the others for
            dead in an icy tomb and stooping to conquer a ton or some of
            bullion.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A year later, the
            boys gather for relief from a good case of get back, brought on by a
            mean-spirited betrayal and a bout of hypothermia. The supporting
            cast get their own usual nicknames and interesting back stories.
            Seth Green a.k.a. Scott Evil, Jason (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Transporter</i>) Statham, hip-hop artist Mos Def, and Franky G morph
            into Lyle a.k.a. Napster (techno-geek), Handsome Rob (wheel
            job/ladykiller), Left-Ear (explosives expert), and Wrench (as in
            Mister Goodwrench), a potpourri of specialists. Green, a natural
            comic, gets the most amusing pissed-off pseudo-history, wherein an
            unfortunate snooze in college allowed his roommate (cameo'd by
            napster founder Shawn Fanning) to steal what would become the
            internet's first popular music service. Stella, seeking closure over
            her father's death, quickly relents to be the group's safebusting
            babe, armed with magic fingertips and a sporty iPod. What a babe!</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the
            film, just over seventy minutes, deals with the slick plans, its
            energetic execution, and the quick-witted alterations as the gang
            plays traffic chess with Steve on Los Angeles' well-congested
            streets to checkmate what's left of the Venetian loot. A small
            portion of that time deals with every American's worst nightmare --
            the cable's out. A bigger chunk is spent watching those marvelous
            BMW MINIs (a centerpiece of the original film) scurrying about
            choked-up arteries (that's why sidewalks were invented), along the
            tracks of the local subway, and through the tunnels of L.A.'s
            oft-filmed (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Them</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Core</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Terminator II</i>) storm drain system. For good measure, some Ukrainian
            mobsters are tossed into the ever-maddening chase.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sure, some people
            are in it for the money. We're here for the fun! Go, watch <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Italian Job</i>, and on the way home pick up a six-pack of MINI
            Coopers. They'll fit in the closet.</font></p>
