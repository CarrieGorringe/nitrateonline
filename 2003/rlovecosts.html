            predominant image that emerges from Troy Beyers' <i>Love Don't Cost
            a Thing</i> is Steve Harvey's teeth. As Clarence, father to the
            film's ineffably hapless, gottagettadate high school student
            protagonist, Harvey embodies an amiable, old-schoolish fo</b></font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>olishness,
            eager to instruct Alvin (Nick Cannon) in the fine arts of dancing to
            Al Green and being a &quot;true player.&quot; These might provide
            nominal jump-offs for Harveyan humor. But at the same time, he's
            trapped inside a remake of the wholly pedestrian <i>Can't Buy Me
            Love</i> (Steve Rash 1987), which means that he's playing a dad
            inspired by John Hughes. Though he mugs energetically and smiles
            extra-widely, Harvey's PG-13 comedy can't fill up the film's
            numerous holes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            of these is the lack of updating or rethinking of basic high school
            movie tenets -- and you know how much these need rethinking. Alvin's
            outsider status is indicated not only by his dated hairdo(s) and
            terrible clothing choices, but also by arguments at home with a
            slightly cooler younger sister, after-school employment (pool boy to
            the wealthy), and affiliation with the resident nerd club (Kenan
            Thompson [formerly of Kenan and Kel], Kevin Christy, and Kal Penn)
            who are, in this case, building a shiny car engine to win a national
            contest and college money. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Cannon, like <i>Can't Buy Me Love</i>'s Patrick Dempsey before him,
            reveals considerable charisma (as he also did in <i>Drumline</i>),
            the film won't cut him a break -- it's relentlessly cartoon-sized,
            never trusting anyone (characters, actors, or viewers) to comprehend
            any little bit of innuendo. Rather, Cannon is subjected to all sorts
            of dopey jokes. When Alvin spots the girl of his dreams at a pool
            party -- Paris (Christina Milian) -- he goofily imagines she's
            beckoned to him, then walks, lips a-pucker in his dreamstate, into
            the very pool he's supposed to be cleaning, much to the derisive
            delight of the surrounding bling bling boys, that is, fellow
            students who love themselves too much. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Things
            only degenerate when the plot kicks in. Miss Thing dents her mom's
            Cadillac Escalade, and as everyone knows, such conveyances cost
            fortunes to fix. Strapped for the $1500 repair bill, she agrees to
            let Alvin buy her for a month, or rather, buy the appearance that
            they're dating, so that for his last 30 days in high school, he can
            see what it's like to live on the other side, to feel revered. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            story goes that as Alvin and Paris spend time performing their
            coupledom, she actually comes to appreciate his &quot;genuine&quot;
            niceness (even as you see Clarence schooling him in how to be a man,
            giving him a shoebox full of assorted condoms). Paris is briefly
            distracted by her girlfriends, who lust after new toy Alvin, and her
            ex, now a pro basketball player who's plainly dallying with
            groupies. At the same time -- and so &quot;ironically&quot; -- Alvin
            becomes insufferable because he buys his own enlarged rep at school.
            Hanging with the cool kids only makes him stupid, or brings his
            inherent stupidity to the surface. Dissing his dad and infinitely
            patient mom (Vanessa Bell Calloway), ignoring his longtime friends,
            he forgets to finish the engine project so he can hang with the cool
            kids and wear the Sean John tracksuits Paris buys for him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            plot point -- that Alvin's desire to be popular overwhelms his own
            ostensible good sense -- might have worked more convincingly if
            Paris, the original object of desire, seemed at all desirable. But
            she's as bland and detached as high school divas come, this despite
            best efforts by the adorable but still awkward Milian. (It's worth
            noting that she's been caught in an &quot;about-to-be&quot; industry
            loop for some time, as her first album has been about to be released
            for two years, and who has just dropped her second first single/duet
            with Ja Rule, this one with her name first -- what that says about
            Ja's rising or falling star is a mildly interesting question, as is
            the odd choice to make the second single sound much like the first).
            She was fine hosting MTV's <i>Wannabes</i> last year, but she might
            benefit from more careful management. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Who,
            for example, decided it was a good idea to have her croon a little
            diary-poem tune with guitar in her lap and blind-shadows across
            Paris' bedroom wall? Alvin comes to visit, and he encourages Paris
            to confess her deepest feelings, so that he might soothe her and
            tell her how special she is. The formula, of course, holds that such
            a scene will show the rich girl's vulnerability, so that her
            developing affection for Alvin might lead to a happy romantic clinch
            (contingent on his own learning of a few lessons having to do with
            loyalty and doing what's right). But the moment is so simultaneously
            mushy and peculiar that it's difficult to feel sympathy for either
            of them. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            blind-shadows in Paris' bedroom raise another issue -- the film's
            oddly edgy cinematography (courtesy Chuck Cohen, who also shot <i>Any
            Given Sunday</i> and <i>Training Day</i>). <i>Love Don't Cost a
            Thing</i> is as unlike a romantic comedy in appearance and tone as
            any I can remember -- scenes are often surprising, with camera
            lurches, wide lenses, and handheld scampering effects. If only the
            camerawork had something to do with (or better, some tonal influence
            on) the plot and dialogue, both distractingly silly. And if only
            Steve Harvey had a few more close-ups. <o:p>
