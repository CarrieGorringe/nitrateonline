            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Griet (Scarlett Johansson), the
            servant girl who's at the center of the film <i>Girl With a Pearl
            Earring</i>, receives this information from Maria (Judy Parfitt),
            and it's difficult to tell whether they're supposed to be words of
            wonderment or of warning. Probably both. Maria is often seen wearing
            a black dress and close-fitting cap that gives her a Mephistophelean
            look, and she turns up at odd moments, as if deliberately keeping
            the serving staff on their guard. She is also the mother-in-law of
            the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, in whose household Griet goes to
            work in the city of Delft in the 1660s. She has assumed control of
            the pursestrings, and the house, ostensibly so that her successful
            and talented son-in-law may be free to work, unencumbered, at any
            and all times.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many busy hands have been at work
            to create the 17th century world seen in the film (Luxembourg stands
            in for the Netherlands), but it is not for vainglorious purposes.
            The sometimes exquisite visual design -- -Eduardo Serra did the
            cinematography, and the production design was by Ben Van Os, who
            previously worked on several of Peter Greenaway's films -- gives the
            impression of Griet gradually becoming steeped more and more in the
            colours of Vermeer's paintings as she moves more and more into the
            Vermeer household. For another, it is to give us an idea of what it
            was like to live and work in an Old Europe upper-class household,
            with its politics that define those who are higher-up and who are
            under employ, what may or may not be said and done and by whom, and
            how one's footing may become precarious or lost depending on how
            well one can silently learns, intuits, or adapts to the strictures
            of place and manner.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of Vermeer's patrons, Van
            Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson, in an unlikely bit of casting), requests to
            have Griet's portrait done -- to hang in his &quot;private
            cabinet&quot;, which we do get a chance to see prior to the end the
            film -- and this subtly upsets the balance of things in the home.
            The painter's wife -- who, as played by Essie Davis, has the face of
            a beautiful but anguished Florentine saint -- resents the commission
            in ways she can only barely express (although it will result in one
            of Vermeer's most famous and admired works of art). And Vermeer
            (Colin Firth) discovers that Griet has an natural sense of the
            aesthetic, something missing in his wife, if she ever had it, and
            which Scarlett Johansson conveys, much to her credit, mostly through
            inner expression.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film deserves to be seen for
            Johansson's work, which is impressive compared to her previous
            performances in <i>Lost in Translation</i> and <i>Ghost World</i>.
            Her face unadorned and framed by a white cap or kerchief, she
            communicates everything we need to know about her character without
            recourse to dialogue -- here is a thinking, feeling girl who has
            opinions, respects and admires beauty, has a deep sense of what's
            right and wrong, and doesn't sell herself short -- she discovers
            that, like &quot;Master&quot; Vermeer, she can interpret her
            surroundings in ways that can be transformed into art -- yet she
            must also traverse every working day mindful of her place (a word, a
            gesture, and she could be out on the street).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like a Pinter drama, much of what's
            going on is in the unspoken. Vermeer enjoys the fact that Griet sees
            and comprehends the same aspects about art and the making of it as
            he. Everyone thinks that something else must be going on between
            them, but the deal is that it is not, and Vermeer, despite his
            talent, melts in the face of opposition. Colin Firth, cast as
            Vermeer, doesn't generate any chemistry with Johansson, though --
            Firth is back in &quot;hopeless&quot; mode, here, staring into the
            middle distance and brooding away. Is he supposed to be Heathcliff
            to Johansson's Cathy? When his Vermeer sees Griet's hair unfolding
            from beneath her starch cap for the first time -- long, beautiful,
            and a moment of revelation (it's the first time the audience has
            seen it, as well) -- he looks as dull-witted and trapped in amber as
            in all his other scenes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And the film itself, despite its
            subject matter, lands with a soft thud. I haven't read the Tracy
            Chevalier novel on which the film is based, but I suspect that a lot
            of the answers are contained there that we don't get from the film.
            Does Griet go on to become anything like an artist herself, or does
            she end up leading a quiet ordinary, if boring, life? Would it have
            made any difference if she had become anything more than a
            handservant to the great painter (unlikely, given the customs of the
            time, but still...)? We never find out what the creation of the
            title painting means to either Griet or Vermeer; the only thing
            Griet is shown getting out of the whole thing is a pair of earrings.
            It's not enough.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
