            is the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen's take on a commercial Hollywood
            comedy, which they smite to the ground and happily deliver a
            thorough pummeling to.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">George Clooney plays Miles Massey,
            a successful attorney specializing in matrimonial law, who is first
            introduced to us, like the Cheshire cat, through his grin -- one of
            his most powerful weapons deployed in the use of negotiating and
            defeating the opposite party in a courtroom (and Clooney was a
            really good sport in letting the Coens do this to him). When he
            meets Marylin (Catherine Zeta-Jones), he senses something below her
            relentlessly poised facade (we even see his eyes flare), and he's
            right -- just like him, she is a born and highly-skilled strategist
            and conniver, only her specialty is in the fleecing of one gullible
            husband after another, perchance her revenge for what men have done
            to women through the millennia.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There has been some voicings of
            concern over the Coens going mainstream (by coincidence, this
            picture came to their attention after their planned screen
            adaptation of James Dickey's novel <i>To the White Sea</i> fell
            apart at the very last minute), but there is no cause for alarm,
            especially when Clooney and Zeta-Jones recognize a kinship in each
            other by trading romantic verse; they end up in a Las Vegas wedding
            chapel, the &quot;Wee Kirk of the Heather&quot;, where someone
            performs &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot; on the bagpipes.
            (There is usually a running motif in each of the Coens' movies, and
            Simon and Garfunkle happens to be it in this one.) There's running
            talk about &quot;the Massey pre-nup&quot;, which &quot;has never
            been penetrated&quot;, and about the guide who helped lead Sir
            Edmund Hillary up Mt. Everest; as well as a trial witness who is
            introduced the same way Rufus T. Firefly was introduced at a
            Freedonia reception in <i>Duck Soup</i>. The film also contains the
            single funniest moment in anything I've seen so far this year (it
            involves the confusion of two objects).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clooney's performance involves
            great style which is delivered with seemingly effortless ease (note
            how he sits the first time we see him in the movie behind the desk
            of his office), while also being able to play broad moments when the
            story calls for it. This is the type of performance which is
            actually very hard to do, since the performer has to gage how far to
            play things with sabotaging his acting or, for that matter, the
            movie itself. Cary Grant (who inevitably pops to mind in comparison)
            could play suave while doing some good, comedic sparring in films
            like <i>Mr. Lucky</i> (where he also did it in rhyming slang) and <i>His
            Girl Friday</i>. Clooney is both suave and can spar well, but he can
            also deliver goofy, even self-parodying moments that Grant could
            never quite pull off. This is arguably Clooney's best screen work to
            date.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Catherine Zeta-Jones, by
            comparison, plays cool, cool, cool, and I found her to be more
            interesting, here, than the hard-puffing work she put into her
            appearance in <i>Chicago</i> (where she never did quite get Velma
            Kelly's solo turns exactly right). She maintains a glittering
            intensity along with the sangfroid, something that keeps us guessing
            to the end over whether her character is completely mercenary or
            still has the capacity to feel. She certainly seems warmer compared
            to her friends -- divorced, rich women all -- who are depicted in
            scenes that are staged as if they were Greco-Roman sylphs reclining
            by an enchanted elysian pool.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But, primarily, this movie turns
            out to be about the joys of love, wherein Clooney's character,
            thoroughly discombobulated by the end, comes to realize that there
            is newfound meaning in his life and that all his cynical words and
            deeds are but for naught. The film offers the wicked amusement of
            seeing when and how a calculating woman will deliver the <b><i>fer-de-lance</i></b>
            to a variety of men, but by the end we end up yearning to see
            whether the two main characters will come halfway and allow love to
            triumph over all.</font></p>
