            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The filmmakers save their trump
            card, it turns out, until the very end, when they show us actual
            footage of Wilhelm Furtwängler being congratulated at the end of a
            concert by Hitler. Furtwängler is then caught, on film, doing
            something which clears up the entire question of just what his
            allegiance was to the Nazis. It's too bad that they couldn't have
            dramatized that in the preceding film.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wilhelm Furtwängler was a leading
            symphony conductor in the 1930s and 40s, considered to be on a par
            with Arturo Toscanini, himself famous for conducting the N.B.C.
            Symphony Orchestra during popular radio broadcasts of classical
            works in the U.S. (I have several vintage L.P. recordings of
            Toscanini conducting the Beethoven symphonies, plus works by Brahms
            and Debussy, and they are of interest for how Toscanini does
            distinctive interpretations of familiar works.) Furtwängler chose
            to remain in Germany, conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, when the
            Nazis came into power. Hitler and his inner circle were big on
            music, using Wagner and Beethoven as examples of truly German art,
            hence Aryan, hence the work of racial superiority. It was Furtwängler's
            sin that he did not altruistically leave Germany when the demons
            began to rule, a sticking point when, after the Second World War, he
            had to go through the &quot;de-Nazification&quot; process because he
            had conducted concerts under Nazi auspices. Yet, Furtwängler argues
            that he kept &quot;art&quot; and &quot;politics&quot; separate,
            never allowing the two to overlap so as to keep them distinct, and
            to keep his &quot;art&quot; pure. Besides, too, Germany was Furtwängler's
            country and his home.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Costa-Gavras' film, <i>Amen</i>,
            depicted another real-life German, Kurt Gerstein, a lieutenant in
            the S.S. Waffen officer who tried to alert the world as to what was
            happening in the concentration camps when he discovered that a
            chemical he had allocated for the extermination of lice and vermin,
            Zyklon-B, was being used to exterminate people. Gerstein chose to
            stay in his position in the S.S. so that he could continue to
            collect evidence that would convince people, and future generations,
            as to what was happening (and his evidence would later prove to be
            invaluable in the prosecution of war crimes). It was an
            extraordinarily dangerous thing to do, but Gerstein was motivated by
            a clear sense of conscience and morality, and of his love for his
            country, the real land that was under the encrustation of the Nazis.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Taking Sides</i> opens with a
            U.S. Army Major, Steve Arnold, being told by a superior officer
            (played, fleeting, by R. Lee Ermey) that he has to &quot;get&quot;
            Furtwängler, who, to the Germans, was &quot;Bob Hope and Betty
            Grable rolled into one&quot;. Arnold was an insurance man in
            civilian life, and, as the story progresses, it's supposed to show.
            He doesn't care for &quot;airy-fairy&quot; stuff, and fixates on
            Furtwängler being the &quot;piper&quot; who played the Nazi
            leadership's &quot;tune&quot;, including leading a concert on
            Hitler's birthday, if not actually playing &quot;Happy
            Birthday&quot; to the Führer himself. Arnold, early on, sees Army
            Corps footage of bodies at the liberated camps being bulldozed into
            mass graves (because of the epidemic of typhus and other diseases
            that were found to be running rampant); when one of Arnold's staff,
            a secretary taking transcription, tries to quit because of Arnold's
            heavy-handed tactics, he shows her the same film, shaming her into
            staying.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ronald Harwood adapted the film's
            screenplay from his own stage play, and István Szabó, who
            previously has made a trio of films on historical personages with
            actor Klaus Maria Brandauer, directed. There are some attempts to
            &quot;open&quot; the action out -- a brief opening sequence shows
            Furtwängler conducting a concert when bombs begin to fall outside,
            bringing things to a halt; later, we see another concert, in
            post-war Berlin, that turns out to be held in what's left of the
            same concert hall -- with no roof, the audience, when it starts to
            rain, simply open their umbrellas and stay in their seats until the
            musicians have finished. (The film's impressive depiction of a
            shattered Berlin gradually pulling itself back together was done by
            the great production designer Ken Adam, and it was photographed by
            the ace cinematographer Lajos Koltai.) But the film's main emphasis
            is on the meetings, or confrontations, between an increasingly
            antagonistic Maj. Arnold and Furtwängler, wan and unable to work
            until the occupying forces clear him to do so. (The Soviets openly
            express that they would love to have Furtwängler over at their
            place -- apparently, Shostakovich isn't enough.) Arnold and his
            staff collect information, some from an archive of secret materials
            collected by a Nazi intelligence operative, and they play recordings
            of Furtwängler's music (the film uses actual recordings of Furtwängler
            on the soundtrack). But that brief opening concert which is
            interrupted is all that we see of Furtwängler at-work; we learn
            about how those who worked with him felt about him, and they all say
            the same thing (he's OK by them), with the exception of one
            second-violinist (played by Ulrich Tukur, who also played, superbly,
            Kurt Gerstein in <i>Amen</i>), who turns out to have been a plant in
            Furtwängler's orchestra, anyway. The evidence that Arnold flings at
            Furtwängler increasingly turns out to be pretty flimsy stuff, a lot
            of it by circumstance or association -- how a music critic who wrote
            a bad review fell into disfavor, Furtwängler shaking hands on one
            occasion with Hitler (a lot of people did), and Furtwängler
            disliking an up-and-coming conductor named Herbert von Karajan (a
            lot of people did, too). Furtwängler doesn't get to say that much
            about his work during the meetings with Arnold, because he can
            scarcely get a word in edgewise. By the time Arnold is shown
            breaking one of Furtwängler's batons in two, we get the idea that
            the real antagonists in <i>Taking Sides</i> are not the deposed
            Nazis (not that they're any good, either) but the arrogant occupying
            forces -- they're less concerned about getting the truth than in
            one-upmanship, and how they go about it isn't any better than the
            ways and means used by the powers that they've just defeated. All
            they want Furtwängler to do is confess, yet, we don't know enough
            about Furtwängler to tell if he's really got anything to confess or
            not. Arnold is working on the assumption that Nazism may still lurk
            in the heart of each and every German, but, watching him grinding
            down the conductor, after a while it doesn't seem to be that big a
            deal whether he played &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Hitler or not.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What actually motivates Arnold more
            and more is the philistine idea of intelligent artists lording it
            about over the uneducated people, but Harvey Keitel's performance is
            so poorly defined in many ways that it's difficult to tell. Arnold
            is also perturbed over why the Jews were singled out as they were
            under the Nazis, as if, the way it looks in the film, Arnold has
            never encountered anti-Semitism in the U.S. (<i>Gentleman's
            Agreement</i>, anyone?) By the end, Keitel has played into all the
            worst aspects of the role and turns Arnold's interrogations of Furtwängler
            into a monotonous series of rants (and Szabó doesn't seem to care
            much what Keitel is doing, either). Stellan Skarsgård, as Furtwängler,
            tries to bring some subtle shading and dimension to his role, but
            the movie really hems him in -- he's reduced to being a man in a
            chair who turns gimlet-eyed under assault. The filmmakers save their
            trump card, it turns out, until the very end, when they show us
            actual footage of Wilhelm Furtwängler being congratulated at the
            end of a concert by Hitler, who goes to the front of the stage to
            greet Furtwängler personally (the &quot;notorious&quot; handshake).
            Furtwängler is then caught, on film, doing something which clears
            up the entire question of just what his allegiance was to the Nazis.
            It's too bad that they couldn't have dramatized that in the
            preceding film.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
