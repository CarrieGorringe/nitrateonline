            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            20 June 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The only thing halfway
            imaginative about this stillborn prequel to the 1994 hit starring
            Jim Carrey (Lloyd Christmas) and Jeff Daniels (Harry Dunne) as a
            pair of blithering goofballs is the title itself. Unfortunately, it
            also allows for some amusing, ungrammatical word play when it comes
            to an appropriate critical response. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">It's
            the dumberest movie I've ever seen! </i>or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I'm
            not sure what makes me maderer—that they made this movie at all or
            that they expect people to enjoy it</i>. Etceteraer, etceteraer.
            Once you suffer through all eighty-two minutes of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dumb
            and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd</i> you'll have had too much time
            to recall other similar misguided executive decisions that greenlit
            such notoriously unpleasant prequels as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Flintstone in Viva Rock Vegas</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Butch
            and Sundance: the Early Days</i>. This one ranks right down there
            with the worst of them.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Under makeup, Eric Christian Olsen
            (Harry) and Derek Richardson (Lloyd) may bear a passing resemblance
            to their older character selves. However, it's screenwriters Robert
            Brener and Troy Miller who appear most to blame. The former, who
            canned the storyline, for thinking further examination of the <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">über</i></b>-oblivious
            odd couple's formative high school years (particularly 1986) was
            worth cinematic pre-examination. Miller, previously responsible for
            the innocuous <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jack Frost</i>,
            directs the material with all the blandness of white toast. Make
            that white bread. Make that stale white bread. Where are the
            Farrelly Brothers when they are so desperately needed? <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dumb
            and Dumberer</i> marks Brener's first film credit, and, with luck,
            his last.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For this year's spread in the blue
            plate sandwich special (Lauren Holly was the vaguely triangular <b><i>objet
            d'affection</i></b> in the first film), shapely newcomer Rachel
            Nichols made a dubious choice to be cast as hot-pants beauty Jessica
            caught between the two moronic beasts. Hey, she's young. She'll
            rebound. Elizabeth Berkley made a similar mistake with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Showgirls</i>
            and she's gone on to occasionally better roles. Other actors --
            especially any who read the script and still signed on -- fare worse
            (but hopefully a few dollars richer), including <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Pie</i>'s Eugene Levy and Saturday Night Live alum Cheri Oteri as
            the mustachioed, conniving Providence Hill H.S. Principal Collins
            and Ms. Heller, a lower brow, higher education &quot;lunch
            lady,&quot; whose sluttish, extrasexular activities border, like the
            rest of the film, on the ridiculous. Mimi Rogers pops Harry out of
            her womb when the film opens in 1969 and provides some deadpan
            sensuality in her fleeting moments on screen, while Luis Guzmán, as
            the school's janitor, cleans up the oversized mustard and ketchup
            notes left by his son, Lloyd. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Full
            House</i>'s Bob Saget has a small role as Jessica's militant dad, a
            compulsive clean freak who misreads (and obviously mis-smells) a
            bathroom smeared with melted Hershey's chocolate (which seems to
            offer way too much of a mess for such a small bar) for something
            more excremental.<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film covers some of the
            expected back stories, including the all-important how Lloyd's front
            tooth gets broken! Wow, that's easily worth the price of admission
            for the two Harry and Lloyd fans (coincidentally named Harry and
            Lloyd) waiting in line since the film opened. Actually, they're
            still queued up the last time I looked. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dumb
            and Dumberer</i> also wanders into a ludicrous plot about stealing
            $10,000 by creating a bogus special needs class faster than you can
            say pop-tart. The boys, recruited for their obvious affinity for the
            lower rung of the educational ladder, become misleaders, gathering
            classmates from among the school's refuse. School bully Turk (Eldon
            Henson, in a role similar to the one he played in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Manic</i>),
            skateboard victim Toby (Josh Braaten), his punk girlfriend Terri
            (Teal Redmann), football casualty Carl (William Lee Scott),
            push-me-pull-me school mascot Lewis (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Holes</i>
            star Shia LeBeouf), and Ching Chong (Michelle Krusiec), a
            make-believe foreign exchange student, &quot;study&quot; together in
            the school's utility shed. Payback against the principal for his
            scheming arrives in the form of a Thanksgiving Day float
            miraculously assembled overnight by the class of ne'er-do-wells.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are attempts at humor
            involving food, flatulence, slurpies (a.k.a. slushies), exploding
            gas stations, and enough lame <b><i>double entendres</i></b> to
            choke a dead horse. One travesty of a joke follows another. It's all
            rather depressingly unfunny (for an idea that had a ton of
            potential), shellacked in a low-budget veneer and unimpressive
            camerawork by Anthony Richmond. This isn't only one of the dumberest
            films I've ever seen, it's a miscarriage.</font></td>
