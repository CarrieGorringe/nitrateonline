            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory
            Avery</a>, 27 June 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The one moment of real surprise
            -- and delight -- I experienced while watching <i>Charlie's Angels:
            Full Throttle</i>, which is otherwise put together fine and gives
            you plenty of bang for your buck, comes near the very end, when it
            is revealed why Crispin Glover's character, the Thin Man assassin
            seen in the previous film, is trailing the Angels (Drew Barrymore,
            Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu) once again: let's just say that two of
            the girls have a guy before the end of the film, and one does not.
            Glover, our great, eccentric, fearless genius actor, energizes
            things every time he's on-screen, no matter how brief a time. The
            rest of the movie is, maybe, a little too energized, and I can't say
            it's really got a piston shot or anything.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the sequences are
            brilliantly edited, and, once again, the Angels are seen facing down
            adversaries without the use of sidearms (something producer Drew
            Barrymore was adamant about in the 2000 film and this one) while the
            story emphasizes (particularly in its conclusion) the strength of
            female camaraderie. Things are knowingly, sometimes wittily, put
            together (the Angels locate some titanium objects by conducting a
            test involving molecular density), the songs used on the soundtrack
            are cunningly selected and deployed, the acting is quite enjoyable
            (Cameron Diaz manages to make her character, Natalie, a bundle of
            joy without ever slipping over the line into dumb-blond territory),
            and there's a giddy blizzard of pop culture references (dig the use
            of &quot;The Lonely Goatherd&quot; in the background of the convent
            scene!) to keep things spry, and celebrity appearances, some
            credited (John Cleese, Robert Forster, Eric Bogosian, Carrie Fisher,
            and Pink, without the heavy makeup, in a motocross scene) and
            uncredited (why, that looks like Bruce Willis! And there's Jaclyn
            Smith!). You can overlook the fact that Bernie Mac does not quite
            seem up to speed with the rest of the picture as the new Bosley
            (&quot;bewildered&quot; is the word that I'm looking for---he seems
            to be looking around for something, anything to play off of), and
            that Demi Moore doesn't so much appear in the picture as seem
            electronically digitalized into it (in her first scene, she shows
            that women over 40 can indeed have flat stomachs, and appears in a
            bikini that looks tinier than any of the swim wear in &quot;From
            Justin to Kelly&quot;).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So my reaction to most of the film
            was...cursory. &quot;Well, that's well-done.&quot; &quot;That's
            nice.&quot; There's nothing wrong with lightweight entertainment to
            take your mind off things -- it may be that the film is trying too
            hard to be lightweight. Justin Theroux appears as a mean ex-con
            (consciously done up to look like De Niro in <i>Cape Fear</i>), a
            shadow from the past of Drew Barrymore's Dylan<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>-- not wanting to trivialize certain aspects of this subplot,
            the film tries to give the dark connection between these two some
            genuine weight and resonance, but it looks really out of place with
            the larking that's going on in the rest of the picture.</font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Film Threat</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            asked its readers, during the film's opening weekend in theaters,
            which of the Angels they would most like to throttle. (Note: never
            use a title that can be used against your picture after it opens.)
            Both of the <i>Charlie's Angels</i> pictures at least have their
            hearts in the right place: I'll reserve judgment until the movie
            version of <i>S.W.A.T.</i> opens later this summer.</font></td>
