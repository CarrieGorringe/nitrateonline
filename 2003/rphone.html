            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>,
            4 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Joel 
			Schumacher's movies are a lot more fun when he's thinking small. 
			When he has a gargantuan budget like he did in the unbearable <i>
			Batman &amp; Robin</i>, his hyperactive visuals would seem like an 
			annoying distraction if it weren't for the fact that there was no 
			content to back them up. His <i>Batman</i> movies are terrible 
			popcorn fare because the humans involved get lost in the gimmicks, 
			making even the coolest of special effects dull.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Somehow when he's 
			got a smaller canvas, a better script, Matthew Libatique's dazzling 
			cinematography and Irish star Colin Farrell (<i>The Recruit</i>), 
			Schumacher's films improve exponentially. His latest was shot in a 
			mere twelve days and seems all the better because of its modesty. <i>
			Phone Booth</i> could be, with some fairness, dismissed as a 
			stylistic exercise. Thankfully, its quick pace and engaging 
			performances make it far more involving than simple experimentation. 
			In fact, for once, Schumacher's acrobatic camerawork and 
			wild-looking editing provide a nice complement to a static location.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Phone Booth</i> 
			takes place in a cramped New York City block that's a little 
			unsettling even though cell phones outnumber guns there. Using the 
			former, publicist Stu Shepard (Farrell) can do more damage than most 
			folks can with a bazooka. As he paces through the streets, his gift 
			of gab and skill with a bluff can turn idle boasting into concrete 
			results. His cocky manner upsets some of the journalists he 
			schmoozes, and he can even play on that dislike to hoodwink them 
			into plugging his acts.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His talents are 
			put to the test when he steps into his favorite phone booth (the 
			only one left in Manhattan) one time too many. Afraid his wife (Radha 
			Mitchell, <i>Pitch Black</i>) might spot his cell phone calls to his 
			mistress (Katie Holmes) on the bills, Stu discovers that someone has 
			been monitoring his visits to the booth and wants to teach him a 
			deadly lesson. When someone rings his booth, Stu answers, and a 
			menacing voice (belonging to a mesmerizing, assured Kiefer 
			Sutherland) on the other end of the line informs the silver-tongued 
			publicist that if he doesn't do as instructed, the caller will use 
			him for target practice with his high-powered rifle.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A couple of 
			convincing warning shots convince Stu the caller is demented enough 
			to support his threat. Worse, Stu's proximity to the recent bullet 
			holes earns the attention of the cops, especially one Capt. Ramey 
			(Whitaker), and the neighborhood quickly descends into a long 
			standoff with the police thinking that Stu is the one who fired the 
			shots.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The script by 
			B-movie veteran Larry Cohen (<i>Maniac Cop</i>, <i>It's Alive!</i> 
			and <i>Black Caesar</i>) makes the most out of the claustrophobic 
			situation. The unseen sniper is especially menacing because he 
			ranges from being gleeful sadist to being an eerie type of avenging 
			angel. Because we're really not sure if the caller is merely toying 
			with Stu or is on some kind of perverse moral crusade, he seems even 
			scarier. He has all of Stu's weaknesses pegged and is immune to the 
			publicist's considerable charm. He also has a creepy sense of humor. 
			When a negotiator tries to talk Stu out of the booth by exposing his 
			own personal foibles, Sutherland snaps, &quot;Let's get this guy a seat 
			on Oprah.&quot; But this is more than even Oprah herself could take.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fact that the 
			sniper is invisible gives less comfort. Schumacher's decision not to 
			muffle Sutherland's voice with a &quot;telephonish&quot; sound is another plus 
			because it makes his ominous pronouncements more immediate, and 
			allows more of the sick glee from the actor's tone to come through.
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's 
			occasionally refreshing about <i>Phone Booth</i> is that the cops 
			who stumble on the stand off aren't stupid. In a lot of alleged 
			thrillers I've had to sit through lately (like <i>Abandon</i>), the 
			police are behind the audience by light years. As the captain in 
			charge of the standoff, Forest Whitaker plays a fellow who can read 
			between the lines well enough to tell that Stu is not in a typical 
			hostage dilemma. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the fellow 
			who's literally under the gun, Farrell plays both the slickly 
			successful huckster and the coerced repentant with equal finesse. 
			Despite Stu's earlier infractions and appalling mendacity, his 
			plight is involving enough to keep the film going.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Schumacher's 
			last movie <i>Bad Company</i>, <i>Phone Booth </i>was delayed 
			because its storyline was too similar to recent headlines. The 
			former film about an attempted attack on New York City was postponed 
			because of 9-11, and <i>Phone Booth</i> seemed inappropriate in the 
			wake of the DC sniper attacks. Despite Schumacher's regrettable 
			decision to begin and end his new movie with a shot of a 
			communications satellite hovering over the Earth (does he have a 
			quota for special effects to use?), <i>Phone Booth</i> is actually 
			worth the wait.</font></td>
