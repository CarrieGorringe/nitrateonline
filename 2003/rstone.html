            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Mark
            Moskowitz, a political adster in Philadelphia, has made a quaintly
            interesting, but too long (at 128 minutes), self-involved
            docu-mystery for the literary-minded. If this was an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">E! Mysteries &amp; Scandals </i>episode of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Survivor</i>, there'd be just one winner (natch), but you wouldn’t be
            able to find him and hand over the million bucks. The filmmaker,
            having discovered a ragged paperback that he bought decades earlier
            and left it unread until 1998, has oddly allowed the book to take
            over his life after a revelatory reading or two or more. (The
            binding on that volume has shattered under heavy use.) He went off
            in search of the author and made a movie about his quest.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Constantly
            positioning himself in front of his own camera, <b><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Times">à</span>
            la</i></b> Michael Moore, Moskowitz may share the same initials as
            last year's bulls-eye for the National Rifle Association and
            Charlton Heston Fan Club, but there's not a smidgeon of muckraking
            in sight in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stone Reader</i>.
            Too bad; it could use some yellow journalism to liven it up. Or a
            little more comedy. It could also use a good editorial whacking, to
            eliminate a great deal of the banal, tangential linkage the
            filmmaker insists on using to flesh out his personal statement.
            While Moore populates his films with acerbic wit and sarcasm,
            Moskowitz goes for an uncomplicated proselytizing to the unknowing
            masses that one of America's greatest authors, one Dow Mossman,
            wrote one heck of a 552-page novel, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Stones of Summer</i>, thirty-plus years ago. The director embarks on
            a two-year expedition for his holy grail, i.e. Looking for Mr.
            Mossman, a one-shot wonder who disappeared off the face of the
            earth, as the filmmaker tells us.<o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully,
            what's left at the core of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Stone Reader</i> is generally choice stuff, interviews with
            people—friends of the director, New York Times book critic, former
            editor-in-chief, literary agent, several authors and college
            professors—that all too often bear out 1) that they have no idea
            where Mossman is (i.e., a running gag), 2) that this is a strange,
            obsessive way to behave (is there a doctor in the house?), and/or 3)
            call me if you find him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Translation:
            you do the legwork, I'll help cut the cake, but I probably won't
            reprint the book.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a profession
            film and copyright researcher (and obsessive genealogist who knows
            how to find more than a few cousins), I immediately began to wonder
            why, once I became aware of the film's premise, it took so long for
            Moskowitz to seek out the illusive one-hit author, akin to locating
            other such singular-work novelists, including Harper Lee (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">To Kill a Mockingbird</i>). Mentioning Lee gave me a chill, as I had
            researched his book for several clients through the years, on the
            basis that its filmed adaptation had fallen into the public domain.
            It hadn't been terribly difficult for me to locate Lee's agent.
            Could I accomplish the same thing Moskowitz spent two years
            sleuthing for and over two hours recounting said search? Well, the
            day after I saw this film I visited the Copyright Office and
            photocopied the registration that the Bobbs-Merrill Company, the
            book's publisher, filed on June 13, 1972. Registration A339808 was
            made for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Stones of Summer:
            A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969</i> as published on April 28, 1972. It
            gave Dow Mossman's address in Cedar Rapids at that time. A plane
            ride to Iowa and a knock on a door could have staved off long nights
            away from the family and perhaps a quicker denouement. Moskowitz
            might have spent more time helping his kids rake the leaves in the
            interim.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, you might be
            saying I'm picky. So what if the director fell asleep in class? He
            turned in his final project and made a decent go of it. In a way,
            there's a certain lyrical charm about the piece, no doubt because of
            his absorption of hundreds of literary works, classic and obscure,
            and how he paints this fixation for all to see. His meandering road
            trips allow him to spend hours with those who share his passion for
            the printed word. Most of us pack clothes, sundries, a book, a
            magazine, a laptop, and other light items when we travel. Moskowitz
            picks from a litter of literature and a bevy of critical analyses,
            many hardcover, and blissfully packs up a box of fifteen to twenty
            books to delightfully share with his next interviewee.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cinematically,
            it's a rather ordinary sketch of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cinema
            vanité</i>. Moskowitz is definitely wearing this book on his
            self-indulgent sleeve. Make that books, as he has a penchant for
            purchasing every copy of the book that still exists and is for sale.
            A friend notes. &quot;Nobody else can read this book because you
            have every copy.&quot; Long out of print, there's no guarantee any
            of us will have the chance at reading <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Stones of Summer</i>. Or finding a copy. My wife couldn't find
            either of the two editions that are supposed to be at the Library of
            Congress.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's the perfect
            film (complemented by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Cet Amour-La</i>, the dramatic retelling of Yann Andréa's novel about
            French author Marguerite Duras and her relationship with a younger,
            literary muse) to re-open Washington's Avalon Theatre, the area's
            latest arthouse reborn, following last month's opening of The
            American Film Institute's state-of-the-art triplex (one screen
            occupying the former K-B Silver, an art deco palace meticulously
            restored) in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Avalon, which
            first opened back in 1923 on the upper north western edge of the
            District of Columbia, has been a longtime family gathering place
            ever since. Its balcony was replaced in 1970 with a second, smaller
            screen. In 1985, then owners Ted and Jim Pedas renovated again,
            adding an amusing mural on the main auditorium done, featuring
            Mercury tossing a reel of film to a cherub across a cloud-filled
            sky. Two years ago Cineplex Odeon closed and ransacked the venue,
            removing everything but the artwork and the will of the upper-middle
            class, highly-educated community. It reopened May 9th as a
            non-profit, locally-run theatre.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
