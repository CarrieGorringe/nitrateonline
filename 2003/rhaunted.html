            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inspired
            by Disney's perennially popular ride, <i>The Haunted Mansion</i> is
            as feeble a film as you're likely to see this year. Too scary for
            six-year-olds and too tedious for eight-year-olds, it seems targeted
            at no one in particular, except maybe those who line up to see every
            movie starring Eddie Murphy in his current big-smiley-squaresville
            incarnation. (Or maybe those who'll be purchasing McDonald's tie-in
            Haunted Mansion Happy Meals, available from 26 November to 18
            December.) Here Murphy plays Jim Evers, one half of the New
            Orleans-based real estate team, Evers &amp; Evers. He and his prim
            partner/wife Sara (Marsha Thomason) promise to make their clients
            &quot;happy for evers and evers.&quot; Mm-hmm. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jim's
            smarmy salesmanship is compounded by his dim singlemindedness. The
            man just can't turn down an opportunity to sell properties. He does
            spend some precious minutes instructing his son, ten-year-old
            Michael Jordan Evers (Marc John Jefferies), on the value of whacking
            spiders in order to get over his fear. And he does note, for a
            moment, the remarkable self-confidence displayed by
            thirteen-year-old Megan (Aree Davis). But the film's first scenes
            are all about showing that Jim's priorities are in desperate need of
            realignment. Thank goodness that he's summoned to a haunted mansion,
            where he will be properly retrained by British-accented ghosts. In
            New Orleans. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Said
            mansion is, no surprise, impressively large, gray, and stony, and
            equipped with cobwebs, thunder and lightning, suits of armor lining
            long hallways, portraits with eyeholes, and secret passages. Jim
            hauls his family along, as they are supposedly en route to a weekend
            vacation &quot;at the lake,&quot; whatever that means. Initially
            alarmed by the fact that the backyard consists of an extensive array
            of very old gravestones, the foursome is greeted by the odiously
            grim butler, Ramsley (Terence Stamp), who announces that they will
            sup with the Master, that is, a pasty long-haired fellow named
            Gracey (Nathaniel Parker). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Immediately,
            Gracey takes a liking to Sara, which annoys Jim, but not enough to
            distract him from trying to close a deal. Likewise, Sara in her pale
            pink suit is impressed by the detailed grandeur of the fireplace and
            the stunning artifacts that litter the joint; only the kids seem
            appropriately troubled by the fact that they must stay overnight
            because the storm has washed out the only road outta there. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From
            here, the film loses all pretense of plot (not that it was affecting
            it so assiduously beforehand) and plunges directly into theme park
            ride-ness: the characters separate and endure one inanely irritating
            event after another, most having to do with dully digitized effects,
            typically introduced by the servant-ghosts, muttery Ezra (Wallace
            Shawn) and earnest Emma (Dina Waters), or a gypsy in a green ball,
            Madame Leota (Jennifer Tilly, presciently red-lipsticked and
            mascaraed so as to resemble Michael Jackson's mugshot). She tends to
            offer up deeply uninteresting riddles, such as, &quot;For the truth
            to be known, you must find the key.&quot; To which Jim has a briefly
            suitable response: &quot;What are you talkin' 'bout, Ball
            Lady!?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid
            the slow-moving dreariness, the film offers up a strange kernel of
            impossible backstory, or maybe just ill-considered backstory. As
            always happens in such formulaic tales, the family has been summoned
            specifically, this time because Sara resembles the long-dead
            Master's long-dead lady love, Elizabeth. But lest you imagine <i>The
            Haunted Mansion</i> might actually contend with the difficulties of
            an interracial relationship initiated during some generally
            antebellum-looking moment (the spirit dancers who swing through the
            ballroom on occasion suggest as much), don't even fret. This saga is
            strictly preposterous. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ramsley
            suggests (backed up by introductory imagery) that Master and
            Elizabeth's love was cut short by their unexpected deaths, hers by
            poison, his by hanging, as he was so grief-stricken he couldn't
            continue without her. But no one raises what seems the obvious
            point, that trouble-making objections to their imminent nuptials had
            to do with race. Or, gee, I don't know, maybe slavery. Such
            oversight might have to do with the fact that the kids and Jim spend
            most of the film exploring mausoleums, getting locked up in trunks,
            and running from skeletons, while Sara's getting the grand tour of
            the mansion's musty attic from Mr. Creepy Knickers, oblivious to the
            dangers besetting her children or, for that matter, her husband. By
            the time all come together for the inevitable big showdown, you
            might be feeling like you've survived a theme park ride that's gone
            on for hours, even if the film's running time is reportedly less
            than ninety minutes.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
