            trees, muggy air, house boats. In <i>Out of Time</i>, fictional
            Banyan Key, off Florida's Gulf Coast, is the sort of place where a
            sultry saxophone sounds about right. It's quite &quot;out of
            time,&quot; as the title suggests, set apart from the usual urban
            hubbub, languid, a little offbeat. It's also the sort of place where
            the police chief, Matt Lee Whitlock (Denzel Washington), spends his
            evenings checking that shop doors are locked. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">When
            he gets a call from Ann (Sanaa Lathan), he doesn't sound surprised.
            Seems someone's broken into her house, and okay, maybe Matt ought to
            head over and check it out. He does, in no visible hurry, walks up
            her steps, knocks on her door. The bad guy seems to be gone, but
            still, Matt wonders, &quot;Did you get a good look at this
            fella?&quot; Yeah, she did: &quot;He kinda looked like you.&quot;
            Right, so he was good-looking? Matt presses with additional
            questions, and, a few more minutes of role-playing later make clear
            that this ruse -- the call, the supposed break-in -- is something of
            a routine for Ann and Matt, and they're climbing all over each
            other, going so far as to mention his &quot;deadly weapon.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            unclever as this lovers' exchange may be, it sets up the film's
            essential concern, namely, the many ways that a black man
            &quot;looks&quot; guilty -- whether or not anyone gets a &quot;good
            look&quot; at him. Still, today, in 2003. Director Carl Franklin has
            explored this idea before, in <i>One False Move</i> (1991) and <i>Devil
            in a Blue Dress</i> (1995), and this time, a stereotypically
            oppressive Southern context is only the beginning. (The original
            script by Dave Collard featured no characters of color; once
            Washington signed on, the whole picture changed.) <i>Out of Time</i>
            is as much about ignorance (as in, willful blindness and cultural
            prerogative) as it about misjudgments and <b><i>noir</i></b>-ish
            deceptions. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Matt,
            for one, thinks he's on top of his situation. This even though the
            painfully beautiful Ann is his high school sweetheart and currently
            married to ex-NFL quarterback Chris Harrison (Dean Cain), and his
            wife, Detective Alex Diaz (Eva Mendes), has recently left him. The
            fact that Chris abuses his wife and tends to bully everyone else he
            knows establishes an extra layer of threat, even if Matt does posses
            that deadly weapon. Though Ann stays with Chris because, she
            insists, &quot;He needs me, I guess I feel sorry for him,&quot; this
            story is a little too old and shabby. (And you've seen this movie
            before.) But it makes a weird sense for the complications embodied
            by Matt; perhaps neither of the lovers is looking for commitment,
            and the risk makes their occasional liaisons seem vaguely more
            thrilling. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Matt's
            investment -- emotional certainly, but also politically, legally,
            and financially -- becomes more intense (and costly) when he learns
            that Ann has cancer, some terrible, fast-advancing type that demands
            immediate, experimental treatment at a facility in Switzerland. When
            other ostensible means of funding fall through, Matt makes a
            sacrifice (one he thinks he can manage), stealing $485,000 in drug
            money from the evidence safe at his office. Such extravagant
            silliness might make you wonder about Matt's capacity for rational
            thinking. The plot turns curiouser and curiouser, however. Almost as
            soon as he delivers the money to Ann, her house burns down, and
            among the smoking embers, the cops find two charred bodies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            this point, the movie turns gloomier, faster, and also more
            predictable, as Matt finds himself framed for the murders. David
            Collard's script draws plainly from previous versions of itself,
            including <i>The Big Clock</i> (1948) and <i>Body Heat</i> (1981),
            in its focus on the smart but careless cop scurrying to stay a step
            of the official law types who would love to jam him up. The rest of
            the action occupies only a few hours in Matt's life, as he is
            running &quot;out of time,&quot; now, in another way, so he's
            simultaneously living outside of it and living way too tightly
            inside, pursued by various parties as he pursues sources he thinks
            might lead him to actual killer. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            fact that he's a black man only makes these several lines of pursuit
            more complicated and more resonant. The most overt example comes
            when Ann's neighbor comes down to the police station to tell a
            sketch artist about the man she saw outside Ann's house the night
            the house burned down. She spots the chief across the room, and
            suggests he's the man she saw, at which point the staff and other
            cops at the police station have a good laugh over this point, that
            all black guys look alike to white neighbor ladies (that is, they
            look guilty). But the film is also subtler than that, never
            forgetting that Matt is never out from under suspicion, from frame
            one. As handsome and charming and as Denzel as he is, Matt is always
            on the edge of trouble, whether because of his own bad decisions,
            or, more often, because of the expectation that he'll be on that
            edge. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            as he spends most of his time worrying over, tracking, and trying to
            understand Ann, Matt tends to push away Alex. Independent-minded and
            professional, she's not about to stay home (or even pretend to, like
            Ann does), and the briefly noted &quot;history&quot; with Matt
            suggests that they tussled over her career, especially as her
            ambition and rewards began to outstrip his. Alex appears to have a
            good sense of how things work, and isn't easily duped. That she's
            willing to be duped by her ex, or go along, even for a minute,
            suggests that she knows something about him that he hasn't quite
            grasped. She's prone to wearing tight A-line skirts and heels on the
            job, but her visible determination and killer stare (as well as
            Mendes' most convincing onscreen performance to date) make Alex
            engaging and complex. That the plot only calls her in to make Matt's
            lack of time more apparent is frustrating, but she serves her
            purpose and then some. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            purpose, to expose Matt's increasing anxieties and sporadic
            insights, does underline <i>Out of Time</i>'s own investigation of

            than they seemed on the genre's generally white surface. Guilt,
