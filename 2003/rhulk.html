            oddest moment during Eric Bana's appearance on <i>The Tonight Show</i>
            (17 June) came when Leno asked him to demonstrate his impersonation
            skills. A popular comic back in Australia before his frankly
            brilliant performance in <i>Chopper</i>, Bana obliged: lurching
            forward in his chair, he scratched up his voice, mumbled and
            glowered, suddenly and a little unnervingly transforming himself
            into Nick Nolte, the self-caricature of a man who plays his father
            in <i>Hulk</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Nolte
            has surely developed eminently mimic-able tics and growls over the
            years, not to mention his most recent signature, the frazzled
            mugshotty hairstyle. In <i>Hulk</i>, he makes the most of these
            markers and then some, to the point that he is easily the film's
            best special effect -- all peery eyes and spastic gestures. And he's
            held off like an effect, not appearing until twenty minutes into the
            film, as David is played in the early sequences and subsequent
            flashbacks by Paul Kersey. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            any incarnation, however, it is clear that David is not just a bad
            dad, but the very worst of dads. He is Frankensteinish, messing with
            nature, abusing his loved ones, aspiring to play god by creating
            life that he might command. As depraved scientists often do in the
            movies, he starts off working for the military (the people with the
            money back in the day), and the film's opening credits sequence
            indicates his experimental focus. Part poetry, part abstraction, and
            part comic book spectacular, the sequence has images of cells
            multiplying and DNA strands dancing are intercut with David's eye at
            his microscope and his increasingly fiercely written notes,
            including keywords like &quot;genetic basis,&quot;
            &quot;regeneration,&quot; &quot;immortality,&quot; and
            &quot;failed!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            last is a big problem. David's failure leads to his own anger and
            frustration, which he works out by sticking needles full of his
            green-glowing experiment in his arm, so that his own DNA changes,
            and when he impregnates his pretty wife (Cara Buono), she produces a
            child who turns shades of green when he doesn't get his way. He is,
            indeed, his father's son. Unbeknownst to pretty wife, David also
            puts needles in the baby's arm, so determined is he to achieve his
            me-me-me regenerative goal. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">All
            this makes David colossally representative, of any number of
            terrible patriarchal ambitions and errors in judgment. The insight
            offered by <i>Hulk</i> is that the next generation is shaped --
            here, literally -- by the one previous. Little does adult Bruce
            know. When he first appears in the film, he's riding his bicycle to
            work at a Berkeley lab, wearing a nerdy safety helmet that his nerdy
            coworker ridicules. His father's legacy pulses inside of Bruce, as
            yet unseen DNA mutations: all he needs is a little gamma ray
            accident (made famous in the Marvel comic books and the TV series
            where Lou Ferrigno played the Hulk and Mr. Eddie's Father played
            Banner), to set those mutations into motion. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Bruce
            is also in the dark concerning the fact that his father is alive.
            Apparently, security at Bruce's lab is lax: David is hired as a
            janitor, so that his first appearance is lurky and ominous --
            pushing his mop like a cranky, hairy Will Hunting. He's been gone a
            long time, having spent thirty years in prison, arranged by the
            other prominent father in the movie, General Ross (Sam Elliot). It
            so happens that Ross' estranged daughter is Betty (Jennifer
            Connelly, whose next role, we can only hope, does <i>not</i> involve
            watering eyes as she gazes upward at the difficult object of her
            affection -- whoever he is). She's Bruce's lab partner and
            girlfriend, though technically, they've broken up at film's start,
            owing to her fear that he will abandon her like her dad did when she
            was a two-year-old, alone in an ice cream shop. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Coincidentally,
            Betty's dad left her back then (temporarily) because he has to run
            off and arrest Bruce's father, who has blown up his lab. This weird
            concurrence -- at the time, Betty and Bruce do not know one another
            -- suggests that both these kids are doomed to lives of sorrow and
            isolation, by their dads (moms being either unseen or only briefly
            breathing), whether their DNA is engineered in a lab or left to
            their parental pool-mixing. Her memory comes to her in
            ice-cream-shop nightmares, unrepressed. His eats him up from within,
            unacknowledged. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            genetic engineering (along with the &quot;repressed memories&quot;
            from which Bruce suffers) does take its sensational toll (otherwise,
            no movie). So it's for Bruce that the metaphor of bad-dadness looms
            largest: &quot;Everything your extraordinary mind has been seeking
            all these years: it's been inside you!&quot; growls David. Poor
            Bruce doesn't stand a chance, pounding the ground and turning green
            and bulgy whenever he gets angry (and the CGI effects are not so
            awful as they looked in the Superbowl ad, but yet distractingly
            unconvincing). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still,
            like most socialized subjects, he appears able to manage the anger.
            He doesn't turn when he has something at stake in not turning, as in
            his effort to keep his Hulk DNA from extraction-drill-wielding
            archenemy Talbot (Josh Lucas looking as obnoxious as he knows how),
            rep for the corporation Atheon. This business signifies all the bad
            global capitalists who exploit workers, positioning Hulk as a mighty
            worker, mightily alienated from his labor. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Where
            Bruce does visible (and visibly dangerous) work in the lab, the
            Hulk's work is largely metaphorical: David calls Bruce his
            &quot;work,&quot; but he is also the emblematic worker's body,
            abused and exhausted, underpaid and underappreciated, that is,
            perpetually enraged and devastating/devastated (and unfortunately in
            this instance, unconvincingly CGI-ed). While eluding the military,
            Hulk heads off to the desert, where he communes with desert flowers
            and multi-colored rocks. While these moments are rather too
            precious, they underline his lack of downtime: Hulk can't get a day
            off. Indeed, when Betty finally convinces her dad and his men to
            back off, she does so explaining that Bruce/Hulk (she sees the
            former, dad sees the latter) just needs a chance to &quot;cool
            down.&quot; Being angry is hard work. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            is where the film starts (but also fails) to make a coherent point:
            Hulk's greenness is stunning against his all-Caucasian background.
            Hulk is the of-color being inside the white guy who's so repressed
            he can't tell his girl he loves her. Is it any wonder that when he
            turns, it feels like a relief? He admits to Betty that when &quot;it
            comes over me, I like it,&quot; his voice husky like dad's. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            repressed body isn't precisely preferable over the uncontrolled
            body, but still, the greenness makes Hulk a little scary. Hulk (or
            better, &quot;Hulkness&quot;) is a threat to the community, the
            reason that prisons have become punishment factories rather than
            rehab efforts, and the reason that prisoners are overwhelmingly of
            color. At first, Betty tries to regain control, calling in dad to
            sedate and study (and &quot;protect&quot;) Bruce, but the results
            are disastrous. The military locks him in a sensory deprivation
            tank, where he floats, laborless, until Talbot gets hold of it and
            endeavors to enrage Bruce so he can extract DNA to sell as weapons
            technology (shades of Burke in <i>Aliens</i>). This call to still
            more sacrifice, to give up more of his body, sends Hulk over the
            edge. Roaring and repetitive action sequences ensue. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            for all the pains taken by military and corporate entities to
            contain Hulk, it is David's sustained effort -- his unsanctioned,
            unholy, self-absorbed effort to &quot;improve on nature&quot; --
            that makes Hulk go so wrong. So that Hulk looks like a victim rather
            than just a monster, the most egregious manifestation of the error
            is dad's own body, which is, at last, so alienated that it absorbs
            qualities from whatever it touches, changing into metal, stone,
            water. If ever there was a metaphor for a man in need of identity,
            David's dreadful &quot;turn&quot; would be it. By the end, he's lost
            even that distinctive Nick-Nolte-ness that made him so eerily
            compelling. At least Hulk has a shape to call his own.</span></font></td>
