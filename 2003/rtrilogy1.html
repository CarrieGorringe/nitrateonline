            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Lucas Belvaux’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Trilogy</i> is comprised of three different genre films (a political
            neo-noir, a comedy, and a melodrama) that share characters and
            storylines but vary in terms of filmmaking technique. The idea for
            such an ambitious project – an undertaking clearly inspired by
            Krystof Kieslowski’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Three Colors</i> trilogy – was hatched after the director experienced
            frustration over his inability to sufficiently concentrate on the
            peripheral characters of his earlier films. Ironic, then, that on
            the basis of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">On the Run</i> (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Cavale</i>), the first of Belvaux’s three films to receive an American
            release (the other two, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">An
            Amazing Couple</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">After
            the Life</i>, will arrive shortly), the French filmmaker would be
            wise to forget about his story’s marginal figures and focus more
            energy on crafting a compelling protagonist first.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After breaking out of prison,
            socialist terrorist Bruno attempts to both reassemble his gang of
            anti-establishment guerillas and exact revenge on those who ratted
            him out to the police years ago. As played by Belvaux himself, Bruno
            is an uncharismatic cipher, an automaton enthralled by visions of
            proletariat uprisings and enraged over the fact that his former
            accomplices – namely, a housewife named Jeanne (Catherine Frot)
            – have no desire to rekindle the revolutionary flame. With his
            comrades unwilling to provide assistance, Bruno teams up with the
            junkie wife of the detective who’s hot on his trail, providing her
            with drugs in exchange for a safe hideout. Bruno’s hazy political
            ideals are of the generic anti-capitalist variety, but the
            irrelevance of his goals (spearheaded under the moniker “The
            Popular Army”) fail to deter him from putting them into practice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bruno is a murderer, having killed
            at least three innocent people during the course of the youthful
            bombings that led to his imprisonment, and yet, like a true
            believer, he justifies such behavior as the unfortunate cost of
            carrying out a just cause. Given today’s climate of
            terrorist-inspired fear and intimidation, one finds it hard to
            accept Bruno as anything but a dangerous lout, and since Belvaux
            seems to recognize that he cannot hope to engender audience sympathy
            with such a brute, he attempts to disguise Bruno as a classic film
            noir protagonist. Thus, Bruno is depicted as a man alienated from
            mainstream society and devoted to his own rigorous code of behavior,
            frequently photographed in enveloping pools of inky blackness. Shots
            of Bruno methodically assembling and dismantling his firearm, as
            well as the image of him lying deathly still on a darkened room’s
            bed, make reference to Jean-Pierre Melville’s <b><i>noir </i></b>masterpiece
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="color:black">Le
            Samouraï</span></i>. Yet it’s obvious that Belvaux is only
            interested in the self-conscious trappings of noir – his film
            employs some of the genre’s superficial elements (characters’
            faces cloaked in darkness, men who exist on society’s boundaries)
            but lacks the doom-laden romanticism and existential malaise (not to
            mention the visceral energy and oft-times perverted sexuality) that
            characterizes <b><i>noir</i></b>. Bruno seems doomed from the
            film’s outset but, unlike the archetypal <b><i>noir</i></b> hero,
            his ultimate undoing seems not the result of fate’s cruel and
            arbitrary hand, but rather that of the director’s affected
            simulation of such extant forces.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What the film does best – and
            perhaps the only thing it does right – is set up an intriguing
            scenario in which we watch a committed zealot flounder about in
            emotional and psychological turmoil. Bruno, still convinced that the
            “bosses” must be punished for their ill-defined crimes against
            the working class, returns to the world only to discover that the
            capitalist system he loathes has long since won the ideological war,
            and that his now-outdated convictions brand him an outsider unable
            to peacefully exist in modern society. If, that is, Bruno really
            subscribes to his own brand of revolutionary fanaticism in the first
            place. When Jeanne confronts him about the lives he’s taken, the
            terrorist weakly and unconvincingly attempts to write them off as
            mere collateral damage, and he spends at least as much time during
            his first week on the lam attempting to carry out personal vendettas
            as he does organizing his socialist uprising. Such ambiguous
            motivations, however, can only work if one finds Bruno to be a
            gripping character in the first place, but his ill-defined beliefs
            and pointless, desperate actions make him the least alluring or
            fascinating criminal in recent cinema. As a portrait of one
            loser’s dawning realization of his own loser status, the film is a
            timely if dull character study. As a suspenseful thriller, however, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">On the Run</i> is a sluggish bore.</o:p>
