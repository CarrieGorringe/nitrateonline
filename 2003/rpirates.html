            Savada</a>, 29 August 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What kind of film reviewer
            chimes in with his comments six weeks after a major film has been
            released? My kind. Listen, if this was a full-time gig, you could
            call consumer affairs. My life is more than just sitting at the
            movies (well, not much more, but still…), and I've been
            decompressing from a international conference (on Jewish Genealogy)
            that I was co-chairing. Anyway, I apologize for the delay, now on
            with the show.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having already come ashore with a
            summer-to-date boxoffice gross of over $261 million since its
            release in July, it's easy to see what has attracted such a wide
            audience to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pirates of the
            Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</i>. Plenty of wild action,
            a well-directed adventure, the requisite number of digital effects,
            a witty albeit slightly flawed screenplay (based on an amusement
            ride, no less), and a dashing cast caught up in their wickedly
            eccentric characters. The downside: it overstays its seaworthiness
            by half an hour and no one seems to figure out that you can't kill
            the undead no matter how you slice and dice them (although it makes
            for amusing, yet extended, swordplay).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gore Verbinski (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mouse
            Hunt</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Mexican</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Ring</i>) may be at the helm of the ship, but its architect is
            producer Jerry Bruckheimer, one of the most influential people in
            Hollywood and one who really knows how to sell a ton of popcorn to
            his audiences. At one point this summer, he had the top two pictures
            in release (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pirates</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bad
            Boys II</i>). And the Walt Disney Company couldn't be happier that
            the Caribbean is real close to their heart and their Florida theme
            park. With <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pirates</i> and its
            other fish-out-of-water tale, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Finding
            Nemo</i>, Uncle Walt's family finds itself with nearly 19% of the
            boxoffice market share this year.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Artistically, the film is a jolly
            roger rollercoaster of fun. The screenplay and screen story by Ted
            Elliott and Terry Rossio, who teamed up for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shrek</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Mask of Zorro</i>,
            among other films, with input from pirate buff Stuart Beattie and
            Jay Wolpert (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Count of
            Monte Cristo</i>), both of whom provided earlier drafts. Of course,
            this wasn't the first film Disney based on a theme park attraction.
            That is going to make a great trivia question some day. (The Answer:
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Country Bears</i>.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, pirate movies, like
            westerns, don't seem to have large audience appeal these days. Kevin
            Costner seems to have reinvented, again, the latter genre with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Open
            Range</i>, while <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pirates of
            the Caribbean</i> was certainly touch-and-go before its release,
            based on more recent swashbuckling duds, particularly Renny Harlin's
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cutthroat Island</i>. For
            those old enough to remember <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Pirate Movie</i> (1982), now there was a disaster of a buccaneer
            movie that should have killed off the genre. It was so bad the
            entire preview audience was talking back to the dreadful dialogue,
            at least making it a memorable evening.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, Mr. Bruckheimer, for
            bringing back the dead.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Does it grab you from frame one and
            maintain its comic rapture for the next 200,000 frames? For the most
            part, yes, and it's mostly because of Johnny Depp's infectiously
            irreverent performance as Jack Sparrow, a devilish rogue of a pirate
            with the audacious street smarts of an eighteenth-century MacGiver
            decorative makeup hints courtesy of Marilyn Manson, and some hair
            coiffing left over from his brief work in Terry Gilliam's failed Don
            Quixote project. Dr. Rick Glassman is given suitable credit for
            Depp's &quot;Dental Special Effects.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a prologue that tickles your
            interest, we’re pushed ahead several years to the bustling Port
            Royal, where a young girl has blossomed into Elizabeth Swann (the
            statuesque Keira Knightley, who reminds me of Brooke Shields),
            daughter of the port's Governor (Jonathan Pryce). The Gov wants his
            strong and independent offspring to marry the ambitious and pithy
            Captain (soon to be Commodore) Norrington (Jack Davenport), a
            villainous authoritarian nincompoop cut from the same mold as Don
            Rafael Montero in Elliott and Rossio's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Mark of Zorro</i>. She'd rather not. Then, Sparrow makes a grand
            entrance aboard (barely) a sinking ship and soon befuddles most of
            the unbelievably gullible British Navy with tall tales, derring do,
            and a great deal of amusing double talk. Lives intertwine. It's all
            quite hilarious.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But darkness fogs the landscape and
            some old, now ghostly, pals of Sparrow arrive in town aboard that
            cursed Black Pearl, proceeding to ransack the neighborhood and
            provide some enjoyable gallows humor, where Jack misses a dawn
            appointment. It seems he's busy elsewhere, with master craftsman
            Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) -- who has a distant wanting for
            Elizabeth -- hijacking the fastest ship in the British fleet. The
            kidnapped modern miss, who seems peculiarly well versed in the
            &quot;Code of the Pirates&quot; (i.e., running gag), discovers the
            ghastly secret of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his
            blunderful, plunderful crew.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pirates, with their skeleton
            crew, and the prissy Brits crisscross the haunted high seas, doing
            battle and crossing swords on numerous occasions, often stopping
            midstream to spit out some barbaric one liners or grizzled
            silliness. None of the living stop to think &quot;Why are we firing
            weapons of mass destruction against people who are already
            dead?&quot; but no one seems to care! There's talk about 882 Aztec
            gold trinkets and the curse of Cortez, of a blood sacrifice on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Isla
            de Muerta</i> (an island set on loan from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Raiders
            of the Lost Ark</i>), and quite a few other Saturday afternoon
            serial shenanigans. It all makes for a feel-good summer adventure,
            even if it sags as it stretches past the second hour.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pirates
            of the Caribbean</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> has a
