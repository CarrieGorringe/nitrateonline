            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 26 December 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me get this off my chest.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's something off-putting about 
			William H. Macy's backside. Its plain vanilla, flat landscape 
			regrettably caught me off guard when it sputtered before the camera 
			in <i>The Cooler</i>, especially when his bony posterior is 
			contrasted with the shapely contour belonging to his co-star Maria 
			Bello. Yeah, the classic character actor Macy (<i>Fargo</i>, <i>
			Panic</i> [rent it -- I know most of you have never heard of it!], 
			and his Emmy Award-winning <i>Door to Door</i>, which he also 
			co-wrote), finally gets to bare his all, literally, in a role that 
			allows him two tenderly torrid love scenes, with comic underpinnings 
			(not to mistake him as a romantic lead, of course), when he's not 
			impersonating the grim reaper of bad luck. For all the confused 
			imagery viewers may suffer at the short (but not brief enough) 
			glimpse of his buttocks, Macy's ugly duckling performance, as usual, 
			makes up for it in spades. That makes sense -- his new film's set in 
			that western gambling mecca Las Vegas. [Note to Bill: please 
			consider your audience the next time you take your consider taking 
			your pants off -- on screen.]</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now with that out of the way, let's 
			ask, have you ever had a string of good luck turn bad? Well that's 
			the driving, twisted notion going on here, of bad fortune, and good, 
			personified in the shell of a schlub. It's an intriguing story from 
			first time feature director Wayne Kramer (who co-wrote with Frank 
			Hannah) who takes a sad sack mensch named Bernie Lootz (no relation 
			to the Massachusetts Lootz's) and magically endows him with bad 
			karma. We're not talking just a simple case of sour superstition, 
			but of an infectiously dark string of bad providence, i.e., a role 
			perfect for Macy's long lists of loser characters. On his new part, 
			he said &quot;this takes the character of the loser to operatic heights! 
			But I liked the idea that Bernie's fortunes are transformed through 
			love, and I will always be drawn to, and am a sucker for, love 
			stories.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Las Vegas, that ever gaudy 
			beacon of excess and entertainment, the powers that be at the Golden 
			Shangri-La hotel/casino have a secret cure for anyone who wins a 
			little too much at the tables. He's got a game leg and shuffles 
			about the floor, brushing up against a roulette wheel here, a 
			blackjack table there, and the stool of a slot machine patron down 
			the aisle, dousing any luck as if the local fire department had 
			dumped a truckful of sand onto a recent triumphant spin, winning 
			hand, or jackpot. The change of luck spreads quicker than this 
			year's flu outbreak. And the folks at the Center for Disease Control 
			down in Atlanta don't even have this on their radar. There's also a 
			long-standing case of resolute drudgery that only lady luck can 
			cure.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This local epidemic is better known 
			to the casino staff, those who notice him,&nbsp; as &quot;The Cooler,&quot; as 
			Bernie's offbeat occupation is aptly named: bringing people's good 
			fortune tumbling down. It's tantalizing to watch the camera follow 
			him as he knocks down a single room, guaranteeing a sour taste that 
			you can't quite place. &quot;Better luck next time,&quot; he dourly passes to 
			a straggler who just gave up on his rotten fate at blackjack&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Self-depreciation has gotten the 
			better of him, or the worse. He's been an indentured servant to 
			harsh master <span style="color:black">Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), 
			who has been running the successful operation (duh) with an iron 
			fist (and pipe) for 16 long years. When Nicky &quot;Fingers&quot; Bonnatto 
			(Arthur J. Nascarella, a.k.a. Carlo Gervasi on <i>The Sopranos</i>), 
			someone with seemingly &quot;family&quot; connections to the bigger 
			organization that owns the Shangri La, Shelly's days as king of the 
			aging casino appear numbered. Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), a 
			bright, young vice president and Nicky's protégé is given a position 
			sprucing up the establishment. Out goes Buddy the aging lounge 
			singer (Paul Sorvino) in favor of Johnny Capella (NSYNC's Joey 
			Fatone), an up-and-coming Harry Connick wannabe. Let's change the 
			wallpaper, pipe in some subliminal messages, and get on Shelly's 
			nerves.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">
			Basically, though, it is a love story, and one that, unfortunately 
			for Bernie, wears it on his sleeve. Casino waitress Natalie 
			Belisario (Bello) takes on Bernie as a pet assignment and then 
			decides to nurse him out of his torpid state of morose humility. For 
			Bernie, love blossoms and casino patrons find that every hand is 21, 
			every roulette spin a winner, and every one-armed bandit offering up 
			rows of sevens. Even though Bernie is on the verge of &quot;retirement,&quot; 
			Shelly doesn't appreciate what a bad job his cooler is doing. A 
			subplot featuring Bernie's estranged </span>jerk-of-a-son Mikey 
			(Shawn Hatosy) and his pregnant girlfriend Charlene (Estella Warren) 
			tossed a wrench in his departure from Vegas&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the direction is extremely 
			polished for a debut feature (with superb photography by James 
			Whitaker, a terrific jazzy/bluesy score by Mark Isham, and slick 
			production design by Toby Corbett, capturing the lower echelon feel 
			of the has-been Shangri-La casino), I felt he pushed some of the 
			luck-filled gimmicks just a tad too much. There's a running gag with 
			a barmaid played by Ellen Greene about coffee and cream that is 
			definitely over-saturated. There are also some neat glossy touches<span style="color:black">. 
			including a neat trick changing a flipping poker chip into a speedy 
			Alka Seltzer tablet. Plunk, plunk, fizz, fizz. And that is Frank 
			Capra's classic <i>Lost Horizon</i> showing on a hotel room 
			television. There's also the script's wry sense of dark humor: the 
			Better Life Motel is where Bernie resides. Yes, there's a vacancy, 
			but a not a drop of water in the pool. And forget the quarter for a 
			vibrating bed, because the hooker and her john are banging the 
			adjoining wall so hard.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Overall, 
			it's a heck of a small little film. Bello and Baldwin both provide 
			extremely well defined characters, with the latter a contender for 
			several year-end supporting actor awards. It's always fun watching 
			Macy make an unlikely winner of a sympathetic loser. </span></font></td>
