            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I'm not sure if <i>Dracula</i>
            works as a ballet, but why not? The character and Bram Stoker's
            story have gone through every type of incarnation, from the stilled
            elegance of Bela Lugosi to the brute fury of Christopher Lee, from
            being turned into an art object for the Broadway stage by Edward
            Gorey to the gross-out job that John Badham made of it in 1979 and
            the wildly overheated, over-stylized, over-subtextualized version
            Francis Ford Coppola jotted off in 1992. There has been at least one
            musical version, plenty of burlesques (<i>Groovy Ghoulies</i>,
            anyone?), and one complete reimagining (F.W. Murnau's film, itself
            remade in 1979 by Werner Herzog).</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here, Guy Maddin takes advantage of
            the non-verbal quality of ballet to create his own silent-movie
            adaptation, replete with title cards, special color tinting of
            otherwise black-and-white photography, and some of the Russian
            Impressionism (Eisenstein's &quot;montage of shocks&quot;) that he
            used to great effect in his furious 8-minute 2001 film <i>The Heart
            of the World</i>. I'm not familiar with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
            production that Maddin's adapting to the screen, therefore I assume
            that they're responsible for one of the film's remarkable additions
            to the story, making Dracula a visitor to Victorian England from the
            Far East, rather than Eastern Europe, and casting Asian dancer Zhang
            Wei-Qiang as the Count: he's handsome, commanding, poised, exotic
            (in the best sense), and you could see why some women would find him
            to be a bit more inviting than the rather dullish Anglo-Saxon
            suitors vying for attention. (Wang's Dracula wears Western-style
            clothes, although Maddin and his associates special tint the inside
            of his cape a bright, bright red.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Choreographer Mark Godden (who has
            set the ballet to music from Gustav Mahler's First and Second
            symphonies) spends more time concentrating on the character of the
            unfortunate Lucy Westenra (very well played by Tara Birtwhistle) --
            whose name, here, has been further Anglicized into &quot;<i>Western</i>ra&quot;
            -- than with virtuous Mina (CindyMarie Small), fiance of the hapless
            estate agent Jonathon Harker (Johnny Wright) and whose own story,
            which took up much of the beginning of Stoker's novel, is condensed
            down to a hurried flashback of imagery. It's probably just as well,
            since Lucy always seemed to be more interesting than Mina, anyway,
            and you always had to make that jump from Harker's encounter with
            the Count to the rest of the story back in Britain (which felt like
            you were seeing one story stop and another start from where the
            other halted). This brings up another aspect of the story which is
            emphasized in the new film, that of men exercising their prerogative
            over women. Other stories, and some of the Hammer films from the
            Fifties and Sixties, have suggested that some of the characters who
            become undead may very well like it that way better than when they
            were otherwise. Maddin's film combines this with an emphasis on the
            xenophobic reaction that Van Helsing and others have towards Dracula
            -- &quot;OTHERS! FROM OTHER LANDS.... From the East!,&quot; as some
            of the title cards scream -- and they seem to take particular
            pleasure in vanquishing Dracula after he has gone on from conquering
            Lucy to trying to do the same to Mina -- they'd rather have dominion
            over their own women, thank you. Mina is saved, again, in the end,
            but it is a melancholy victory and one that comes at a price. If you
            have any interest in Dracula, <i>Dracula</i>, or Guy Maddin's way of
            taking old film styles and using them in new, inventive ways, than
            take a look at this film.</font></td>
