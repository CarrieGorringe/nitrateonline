            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>An underdog
            favorite in the documentary feature category at this year's Oscars
            (Like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bowling for Columbine</i>
            wouldn't win?), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spellbound</i>
            is an overwhelmingly refreshing, and extremely palpitating, look at
            the 1999 competition that was the seventy-second annual Scripps
            Howard National Spelling Bee. Way down the must-see rung from the
            Superbowl, the World Series, or collegiate basketball's Final Four,
            first-time feature producer-director-cinematographer Jeffrey Blitz
            and his co-producer Sean Welch have packed nearly as much excitement
            in what is not generally considered a stimulating spectator sport.
            Lucky film festival audiences (South by Southwest, Woodstock,
            Hawaii, Cleveland) caught on to the film's intoxicating <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">joie-de-vivre</i>
            last year, lavishing well-deserved praise and prizes. Now the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>rest of America can expect to be caught spellbound courtesy
            of Toronto-based indie distributor Thinkfilm, Inc. Arranging words
            in their correct order hasn't been this much fun since Dan Quayle's
            potatoe blunder during his failed 1992 presidential bid provided
            years of comic fodder.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">More engrossing
            than an episode of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Survivor</i> and without the commercial interruptions, this
            ninety-seven-minute digital excursion into the corners of America
            (first half) and the tension-filled finals in Washington, DC (the
            rest), follows the paths of eight young teenagers as the advance
            through their regional competitions, studiously preparing for
            bragging rights in their neighborhood classrooms, local school
            district, home county, geographic region, or some such territory, as
            nine million pessimists, optimists, and realists are whittled down
            to the chosen 249 national qualifiers.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blitz was
            enthralled with the &quot;action&quot; when he watched the 1997
            finals, undoubtedly just as emotionally wringing as those captured
            in his film. This isn't as outlandish as it may sound, considering
            the ESPN commentators (that sports network broadcasts the final
            rounds live) give running odds on the youngsters as round after
            round thin the rolls, cue the occasional tear, and break a heart or
            two, no matter how poised these adolescents appear to be.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The filmmaker and
            his small crew apparently researched their potential subjects in
            tracking the front-runners, hoping that one of the kids they were
            documenting for back story would be crowned champion. I heard that
            more than the eight featured children and their families were taped,
            but that director Blitz and editor Yana Gorskaya recut some in and
            out of the film prior to its commercial release. I suspect some of
            those contestants left on the cutting room floor will be highlighted
            somewhere on the home-video DVD version.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's stars
            cover an economic, social, and ethnic gamut. Their personalities are
            just as diverse. Starting on the dusty, desolate streets of
            Perryton, Texas, Angela Arenivar, daughter of a Mexican ranch hand
            who doesn't speak English, nonetheless receives her parents' devoted
            pride and attention (all the challengers share strong family, and
            teacher, commitments). Ubaldo and Concepcion's only wish for their
            children—that they receive a better education in the United
            States—appears to have come true. In Tampa, Florida, ninth grader
            Nupur Lala practices violin and remembers her previous year's
            elimination, hilariously recreated by several of her classmates.
            Meanwhile in Rolla, Missouri, tall, lanky, and wearing deep, intense
            eyes, Ted Brigham helps his parents raise peacocks. He likes guns,
            explosives, and bows &amp; arrows. &quot;I'm really good at
            math,&quot; he adds. Up in New Haven, Connecticut, Emily Stagg, a
            tenth grader with Harry Potter eyeglasses (a common style here),
            fiercely wants to excel in everything. Ashley White, a black
            youngster living in the nation's capital, has a dutiful mother who
            smokes and a father who seems to be out of the picture (two uncles
            are incarcerated). But there is a loving extended family that
            supports this honor student, who learns words using scrabble tiles
            with her teacher. On the other side of the country and economic
            scale is twelve-year-old Neil Kadakia, a San Clemente boy living
            with his efficiency-expert parents and a family of over-achievers.
            Dad built the coastal-view house they live in. Spring back across
            the country to Ambler, Pennsylvania, and there is April DeGideo, her
            &quot;Bee Happy&quot; parents, a funny little dog, and a horribly
            abused dictionary. &quot;Smithsonian material&quot; her mom jokes.
            This girl devours medical dictionaries in a single reading. Rounding
            out the group is the loquacious, wise-cracking Harry Altman from
            Glen Rock, New Jersey. He probably puts more words on the soundtrack
            than the other seven boys and girls combined. He's quite an
            exuberant character.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blitz gives
            effective flavor to the kids, their families, and their mentors,
            showcasing the group determination that pervades all their lives.
            For tension, he uses the ticking of a clock and a nervous
            harmonica/xylophone score (by Daniel Hulsizer) to build the anxious
            moments when national pronouncer Dr. Alex J. Cameron (who died this
            past February after having enunciated more than 18,000 words) is
            tossing the likes of &quot;cephalalagia&quot;, &quot;mattock&quot;,
            &quot;corollary&quot;, &quot;hellebore&quot;, &quot;banns&quot;, and
            even &quot;yenta&quot; at the contestants.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blitz adds a few
            pieces of fluffy filler, including a brief interview with Frank
            Neuhauser, the original 1925 winner, and Paige Kimble, the 1981
            winner and current director of the National Spelling Bee.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's hard to
            believe that a film about spelling can be such grand entertainment. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">S-P-E-L-L-B-O-U-N-D</i>
            is spellbinding. Yeah, there's no way I would ever want to play
            scrabble with these kids!</font>
