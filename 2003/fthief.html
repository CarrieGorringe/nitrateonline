<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">Neil 
Jordan hunkers down on the Four Seasons' brocaded sofa, peering occasionally out 
the window to the sunny day. Best known for his dark and moody films -- for 
instance <i>Mona Lisa</i> (1986), <i>The Crying Game</i> (1992), <i>The Butcher 
Boy</i> (1997), even <i>Interview with a Vampire</i> (1994) -- the 
fifty-three-year-old, Irish-born novelist and filmmaker is possessed of a 
striking self-awareness and sly sense of humor, as well as an impressive store 
of film history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">He's in town to talk 
about his new film, <i>The Good Thief</i>. Designated a &quot;remake&quot; of Jean-Pierre 
Melville's <i>Bob Le Flambeur</i> (1955), it's more like a combination 
deconstruction and elaboration. By turns lively and dark (and sometimes both at 
once), <i>The Good Thief</i> stars the world-weary Nick Nolte as the world-weary 
Bob, an American thief and heroin addict self-exiled to Nice. Here he's 
surrounded by an assortment of international characters, played by Tchéky Karyo, 
Emir Kusturica, Ralph Fiennes, Saïd Taghmaoui, Ouassini Embarek, Marc Lavoine, 
and newcomer Nutsa Kukhianidze. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Cynthia Fuchs:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
The film has a decidedly &quot;global&quot; cast and sense of style. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Neil Jordan:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Basically, I was asked to do a remake of <i>Bob le Flambeur</i>, and I came up 
with the concept where it would be set in Nice, and I just wrote into it all the 
characters who you'd find around there, like the little Russian refugee. I went 
to Paris to cast it. I met Emir Kusturica, who had been in <i>The Widow of San 
Pierre</i>, and, as he says himself, he doesn't act but he does have a bit of a 
certain presence. Saïd Taghmaoui, I knew from <i>La Haine</i> and a number of 
other films. And Ouassini Embarek, the wonderful actor who played Said, I just 
met him in Paris. Tchéky Karyo I'd known, I loved what he'd done in <i>Nikita</i>, 
and other films where he'd played &quot;baddies,&quot; you know, where he scowls. But he's 
a really lovely actor; you have a sense of him being a real person with whatever 
he does. And Nutsa [Kukhianidze], I met during auditions. I met as many actors 
as I possibly could, from Russia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and when she 
walked in, she was remarkable.&nbsp; </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Given the pervasiveness of the U.S. film industry, it's good to see a movie that 
embraces -- or even acknowledges -- this spread of experience.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Yeah, that was the basic idea. Normally when they remake movies, they set them 
in America, don't they? I don't think this story would work there.</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Did anyone ever suggest that to you?</span></p>
<p><font size="2">
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">N</span></font><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">J:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
No, they didn't. It was more a matter of me trying to come up with something 
interesting enough that I wanted to do myself. Warner Brothers had the rights to 
the film and I wrestled with the script, trying to make it as much fun as I 
could. And to try it make it more a character study of Bob. He's a man who's got 
all these problems, he's kind of failing, trying to bring himself back to life 
through a robbery, basically. So, it was more about that than the original 
movie. The original movie was more about style. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And he seeks this redemption in a kind of class infiltration, or transgression?
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Well, Monte Carlo is the perfect place to want to rob, because it's full of all 
this pretentiousness. It's the most annoying place, run by Prince Rainier, who's 
probably a nice man. But someone described it once as a place where the police's 
job is to play the criminals. Monaco is run like a business, by the <b><i>
Société de Bain</i></b>, which means the Society of the Bath. When we were 
trying to get permissions to shoot, it was extraordinarily complicated, and in 
the end, you have to go to the Prince.&nbsp; </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
They're concerned about image, how the movie might make the area look? </span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
They didn't like a movie about this character; if it had been James Bond, I'm 
sure we wouldn't have had any trouble. But we had to make our own casino, for 
what we needed to do. They only give you permission to shoot when the gambling's 
finished and before it starts again the next day, so you've only got about four 
hours. And they leave it open as long as <i>anybody</i> is doing serious 
betting. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Bob is a serious gambler. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
In my mind, I wanted to start with characters in the worst possible state. And 
the only thing that will get him to clean up his act, to give up his narcotic 
habit is the impossibility of this job. The movie was about him getting himself 
back into that state of elegance and style where he can happily wear a tuxedo 
again, and put himself in a position where, if luck does come his way, he can 
take advantage of it. But that was the main thing in the original film, wasn't 
it, the way that luck comes into his life? </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
I was happy to see the Polish brothers, and here (as in their own work), they 
embody a kind of doubleness of experience and view. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
I just doubled everything that was in the original film. I use the original 
robbery as a decoy; there are two collections of art, a pair of twins trying to 
execute the robbery that Bob is pretending to execute, and, because I had 
doubled everything up, there had to be two endings. I suppose it was my way of 
getting around the idea of doing a remake. The Melville movie is beautiful. It 
seems to occupy a pivotal place in so many film lovers' minds. And it's quite 
small. And it's not his most resonant or engaging film, more of a chamber piece. 
And it's a very American film, his version of <i>The Asphalt Jungle</i> [1950]. 
And Robert Duchesne is doing a Sterling Hayden, isn't he? So, it's a French copy 
of an American film. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
That opens up something of a philosophical question: can art be &quot;original&quot; in 
any sense? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Well, everything refers to something else, doesn't it? It's almost like it's 
gone beyond the point where there's even an argument about it. <i>Far From 
Heaven</i> is a Sirk copy, and Fassbinder made a copy previously. What I kept 
thinking of when I was making this movie was <i>The Long Goodbye</i> [1973], 
with Elliot Gould. That was kind of a delightful lope, and any original ideas 
weren't Altman's, but he just kind of bounced in and out of plot, and referred 
to it when he needed to, and let the characters do what they wanted. I was asked 
to do an article on [Luchino] Visconti's <i>Ossessione</i> [1943], his version 
of <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i> [1946; both films are based on James M. 
Cain's 1934 novel]. They're both the same story but they have almost nothing to 
do with each other. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
What are the connections between writing and filmmaking for you? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
I can't do a film if I don't start with the writing. I can't even know where to 
place the camera or where to get a visual image. I write the script first, to 
see if it's even vaguely interesting, and then if the script becomes compulsive, 
then I can do the film. But that's because I started as a novelist, and I 
suppose it's where the ideas come from for me. For me, the filmmaking has to be 
about the dramaturgy. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
That suggests that films are specifically about characters for you, 
externalizing some sort of internal state. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Oh yes. Particularly projects like this film. Heist movies are based on very 
simple principles [laughs]. A bunch of guys get together to rob something, and 
they succeed or they fail. In the more interesting ones, they generally fail, 
don't they? They always use the idea of the robbery for a center point for the 
needs, desires, or failings or possibilities that people have. That was what was 
interesting about this movie. I decided to keep the aspect of it underneath the 
exploration of character. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And what function does the heroin addiction serve here? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
The idea of an older man putting heroin into his arm is so awful, in a way. And 
there are quite a few people who do that, who have lived with these on and off 
habits quite late into their lives. So, it's the idea of starting in that place, 
a really abject and self-destructive place. And the character that Nick plays 
does nobody harm, in a way, except himself. In a strange way, it didn't give him 
nobility but it gave him an odd kind of moral core even though he's a thief. I 
know it's quite an amoral movie, but it's not the kind of amorality you find in 
the average action film, where people happily blow all other people away. 
There's only one shooting in this film, to which Bob reacts with outrage. The 
addiction became the character. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And it defines his relationship with Anne. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Absolutely. Well, at the very beginning, yes: she's too young to be in that 
[bar] and he's too old to be doing what he's doing [shooting up]. When you write 
something, you start from a place, and you stick with them or you don't. </span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
How much shifting of ideas or plot points do you do once you're into production?
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
This one, this was kind of set, because there was so much talk. Characters don't 
do that enough in films, and here they talk a lot. And, half of it you can't 
hear, I'm aware of that! [laughs] So the rapidity of speech was already written, 
and they can't really improvise it. There were a couple of points where Nick and 
Nutsa wanted to try a few things, but there was a texture to the stuff I'd 
written, so we went back to the script. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
In that sense, it reminded me occasionally of good screwball, when the dialogue 
is so fast and complex. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And these characters are lying all the time. Actually, Nick is a very practiced 
liar. I was at the Toronto Film Festival and we were showing the film for the 
first time, and he was telling the audience of journalists that he experimented 
with heroin for the part. And I looked at him, with my eyes wide, and said, &quot;You 
didn't tell me that.&quot; And subsequently, he said he was lying. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
It's a beautiful film, and I'm wondering how you worked with Chris Menges for 
those visual details. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
There are many great cameramen, but often they have the same style from film to 
film. And Chris rethinks it from the ground up each time he does it. We looked 
at a lot of Hong Kong movies for this, all that neon at night. So it's becomes a 
beautiful style, the wipes and flares that neon gives you. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Most spectacularly, in the Kusturica character's warehouse. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Yes. But because we were shooting in Nice, in the old town, there was none of 
that available light around. So, we built in all these different light sources, 
eliminated everything we could but principals. And we hung these lights over the 
top, and it kind of created its own atmosphere. I decided to use a very mobile 
camera, a lot of handheld and Steadicam shots, which I normally am averse to. I 
wanted the camera to give the impression of the way you look at the world when 
you're hung over, all your nerve ends are shattered, and movement is jagged. The 
lights flare too much. Menges being the kind of artist he is, I'd be shooting 
all this incredibly jagged and mobile stuff and every time you'd look into the 
frame, it was a beautiful shot. So there was combination between ragged and raw 
camerawork and incredible texture in the images we ended up with. And it became 
richer as we came to the casino scenes. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And it gives the film a very different sensibility than those usually set in the 
South of France, which are &quot;respectful.&quot;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Oh yes, it's always that horrible bright light (laughs). </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And it's Bob's internal state reflected.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
But Nice is actually quite a grimy town. It's now full of East European and 
Russian money. A bit like a glittery place that attracted different versions of 
what we used to call the mafia. But it's not immediately apparent to you if you 
walk around the place. So, we made it look more like what it actually is. It's 
using the real environment as a set, similar to what we did in <i>Mona Lisa</i>. 
In most ordinary parts of London, it's suburban or an ordinary city, but I 
wanted something quite lurid and hellish. You have to add things to the streets 
and redesign the environments you choose. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
How do you think about relationships between films you've done, even from film 
to film? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
The one before this was <i>The End of the Affair</i>. And I think I often choose 
to do something because it's quite different from what I've done before. It's 
not confusing to me but it seems to be confusing to a lot of people. <i>The End 
of the Affair</i> is almost like a play. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And [Graham] Greene's structure is so refined. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Yeah. And all the dramatic movement was internal. This is quite different. This 
kind of had to be pleasurable, and had to give pleasure in ways that I've not 
had to do in films before. It's the opposite journey from what I've usually done 
with films. I find it very easy to go from, say, a lit, pleasurable environment, 
like what you see outside there, to a very dark place. But the opposite journey, 
which is what this movie takes, is much more complicated.</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
How were you thinking about the Picasso forgery that Bob so adores? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Well, Bob knows his Picasso is a fake, though the idea of it is so dear to him. 
He's a minor criminal who's mythologized himself. He's a thief, probably not a 
very good one. He's obsessed with numbers, theories of probability that go along 
with gambling. He's invented this story to himself about Pablo Picasso because 
[Picasso] is &quot;the best thief who ever lived.&quot; He admires the thievery of imagery 
and influence, and putting them together to make something new. He would love to 
be that kind of thief, but he's not. He's a basic failure. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
But he recognizes greatness. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Yes, and he's excluded from it, totally. Whence probably comes his heroin 
problem! These characters are all excluded, from a certain kind of significance? 
And they don't end up doing what they intended to do, at all. A higher power 
grants them and evening of luck. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And Anne embodies that. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Yes, exactly, He meets her, &quot;rescues&quot; her, in his way, and she thinks his 
interest in her is sexual, and takes her clothes off. He says, &quot;No, sorry, 
you're wrong.&quot; She puts her clothes back on. Not quite like that, but that's 
basically what happens. He's there to teach her a few lessons in survival, 
because he knows she's not going to change. He knows she's not going to study 
nursing, that she's going to be attracted to action and glamour. And so, he 
teaches her a few tricks. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
He sees himself in her. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Absolutely. And she's learning to be him. And to negotiate the world with a 
minimum amount of damage, which I think is lovely, really. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">CF:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
And he's willing to be what she needs. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">NJ:</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
Oh yes, a father. The thought that there'd be any sexual contact between them 
would be repulsive, wouldn't it? But they do that sort of thing a lot in the 
movies, don't they? People seem to buy it. But I thought it would be lovely if 
they had this very pregnant relationship between them, with sexuality removed.
