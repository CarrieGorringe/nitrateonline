            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>,
            2 May 2003</i></font>
            <p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Breaking the 
			cycle </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Nick 
			Broomfield's <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i>, now available on DVD from Razor 
			&amp; Tie, opens on a famous photo of the Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur 
			-- together. Each appears to be trying to out-thug-pose the other: 
			B.I.G. stands with his head tilted to the side, his black headrag 
			pulled low over his large eyes, as Tupac Shakur, equally artful, 
			throws his hands up, both offering a &quot;f*ck you&quot; to the camera, 
			representing the way he used to do. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As the camera 
			passes over this image -- so frozen in time and now, after all the 
			violence and grief, so sad -- Broomfield's voiceover explains the 
			occasion for his film. Tupac was shot to death in a car in Vegas on 
			7 September 1996, and Biggie was murdered just six months later, 
			outside a party in L.A. He wonders aloud how these two one-time 
			friends came to an apparently fatal enmity. But this introduction to 
			the vagaries of hiphop industry competitions is only a hook. 
			Broomfield's film is less interested in Biggie and Tupac per se than 
			in the simultaneously extraordinary and mundane circumstances 
			surrounding their deaths, in particular, the frustratingly 
			go-nowhere &quot;official&quot; investigations. </font></span></p>
			<p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Biggie &amp; 
			Tupac</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			picks up arguments made elsewhere, by others, including ex-LAPD 
			officer Russell Poole (who claims his investigation was thwarted by 
			superiors) and Randall Sullivan, author of <i>LAbyrinth</i>, that 
			the murders resulted from a combination of gang and cop vengeance 
			plots and have since been covered up by a variety of conspiracies. 
			(It also argues against Chuck Phillips' suggestion, in the <i>Los 
			Angeles Times</i> in 2002, that Biggie paid to have Tupac killed and 
			was in Vegas at the time of the shooting.) </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Versions of the 
			corrupt L.A. cops story have been told before, in a 2000 article in 
			the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> (Lou Cannon's &quot;L.A.P.D. 
			Confidential&quot;), as well as 2001 articles in <i>Rolling Stone</i> 
			(Sullivan's &quot;The Murder of the Notorious B.I.G.,&quot; 8 June) and <i>The 
			New Yorker</i> (Peter Boyer's &quot;Bad Cops,&quot; 21 May), as well as a <i>
			Frontline</i> documentary about L.A.P.D. corruption that same year. 
			Essentially, Broomfield, with Poole's on-camera help, makes 
			connections among several L.A.P.D. officers (Rafael Perez, David 
			Mack, and the late Kevin Gaines among them), the Rampart scandals, 
			and the Biggie and Tupac murders. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Broomfield 
			comes at this morass of egos and exploits as he comes at all of his 
			filmic subjects, as an outsider looking for &quot;answers.&quot; In this role, 
			he's earnest and dogged, outwardly naïve and even stammering on 
			occasion, but always wryly commenting and asking aloud the questions 
			that might occur to anyone without a background (and some with a 
			background) in the particulars and personalities. Much like his 
			previous films -- for instance,<i> Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a 
			Serial Killer</i> (1992), <i>Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam</i> 
			(1995), <i>Kurt &amp; Courtney</i> (1998) -- this one pushes at the 
			limits of traditional documentary. Broomfield presents himself as a 
			pseudo-valiant, persistent pursuer of &quot;truth,&quot; liking especially to 
			look for it in places where others have not, and implicitly acceding 
			that everyone has his or her own truth to tell. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is 
			Broomfield's great insight, worth repeating in all his films: truth 
			is messy and unstable, truth is self-serving (even if that self 
			might be, on occasion, Broomfield), and truth is produced by the 
			beholder's interests and investments. Broomfield's films don't 
			feature much objectivity. Rather, they give the concept a good 
			going-over, so that, by the end of each, you're likely to be less 
			sure of your own reading abilities than you were at the beginning.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This can be a 
			very good thing. <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i> is best when it's not making 
			assertions (most of which are not new), and is instead challenging 
			the very idea of making assertions. As Broomfield notes on the 
			commentary track, his &quot;interview method&quot; can seem transparent: he 
			like to repeat a last word spoken by a subject, as this may help the 
			subject to build on an idea. He &quot;enjoys&quot; his interviews, treats them 
			as &quot;conversations&quot; more than examinations or quests. The film is 
			about process, exposed as equally ludicrous, methodical, accidental, 
			and/or fortuitous. As an investigation of investigations, the film 
			is a little meta, but that only makes it more compelling, more 
			knotted, more galvanizing. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Tracking people 
			who may have known Biggie when he was rhyming on the sidewalk 
			outside a Brooklyn barbershop, Broomfield sticks his mike in 
			someone's face, and she hides: &quot;He de bomb,&quot; she says, but &quot;I don't 
			want to be on TV.&quot; Then Broomfield trundles off to visit Tupac's 
			former bodyguard, Frank Alexander, recently born again and living 
			with several Rottweilers, still fearful even after writing an 
			autobiography. When Broomfield asks Alexander about his assertion, 
			in the book, that &quot;words circulated&quot; concerning Suge's part in Pac's 
			murder, he hems and haws, underlining that these are not his words, 
			but someone else's that &quot;circulated.&quot; Or again, Broomfield goes to 
			see one &quot;witness&quot; to LAPD planning and shenanigans, a guy named Mark 
			Hyland, &quot;the Bookkeeper,&quot; suffering from Tourette's Syndrome and 
			depression (he's also in jail on thirty-seven counts of 
			impersonating a lawyer). He literally cries while recalling his 
			money-moving schemes. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The DVD 
			includes a couple of &quot;Failed Interviews,&quot; one that Broomfield 
			introduces: &quot;This is us being chucked out of a private housing 
			estate in New Jersey,&quot; where they had gone to interview Damien 
			Butler, a witness to Biggie's murder who was now &quot;frightened one way 
			or the other.&quot; As Broomfield describes it, the moment is &quot;one of 
			those humiliating experiences that one goes through when making one 
			of these kinds of films, so we thought we'd put it in.&quot; The second 
			shows the Last Resort bar in the heart of the Rampart area, where 
			Mackie and other cops would &quot;hang out.&quot; Broomfield's questions to 
			the bartender are summarily rebuffed. As well, the DVD features some 
			rough, in-the-studio music tracks by Tupac's stepbrother Mopreme, 
			whose interview with Broomfield is particularly poignant, the 
			Outlawz (Tupac's backing band), footage of Tupac in the studio, as 
			well as a rhyme by Biggie's associate Chico. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While these 
			extras helpfully illustrate problems and, to an extent, the excess 
			-- of feeling, care, and dedication that documentary-making entails, 
			for the most part, <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i>'s argument stems from the 
			filmmakers' plain affections for Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mother, 
			whom he calls a &quot;former schoolteacher... who appeared in the video 
			for 'Juicy'&quot; (at which point you see her in the video, as well as 
			her son's visible respect for her). She plays a role reminiscent of 
			Kurt Cobain's aunt in <i>Kurt &amp; Courtney</i>: kind and sincere. Not 
			only is Miss Wallace charming and helpful in the filmmaking (when 
			Broomfield can't get an interview with Lil Cease, she has him sit 
			and wait at her home while she calls Cease, and gets him to come on 
			over right that minute), but she is also generous with her time and 
			fond memories of Biggie (&quot;My son was a poet&quot;). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The same cannot 
			be said for Pac's mom, Afeni Shakur, whom Broomfield describes as a 
			&quot;former Black Panther&quot; (which everyone knows already, but somehow it 
			seems part of a legacy of &quot;violence&quot; here) and as keeping a tight 
			control on materials and still-to-be-released tracks. Afeni remains 
			affiliated with Suge Knight, as they continue to release Tupac's 
			work. And if she won't be interviewed, he, eventually, will. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">To get access 
			to Suge, Broomfield must go through several intermediaries, 
			including the prison warden at Owl Creek, where Suge's serving time 
			(he's since been released). One of Suge's reps warns Broomfield not 
			to try to &quot;use&quot; Suge like he obviously used people to &quot;elevate&quot; 
			himself and make them look stupid. If Broomfield screws up, this guy 
			says, &quot;Anybody who's black in the prison won't be speaking to you.&quot; 
			Articulating the race difference and fear that underlie the business 
			of gangsta rap as well as the supposedly ongoing investigations into 
			the murders, this threat also leads to a scene in the prison, where 
			the black and Latino inmates look askance at the camera as 
			Broomfield and crew make their way along the sidewalk. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Broomfield goes 
			on to make the sort of dry observations for which he is most well 
			known (and, not to put too fine a point on it, beloved). When his 
			usual cameraperson opts out of the trip to see Suge in prison, he 
			notes this is out of concern for &quot;self-preservation.&quot; As well, 
			Broomfield observes that Suge only agrees to the interview after 
			some cogitation, and apparently, knows a little something about 
			Broomfield's work, insisting that there be &quot;No slander and funny 
			stuff!&quot; That Broomfield repeats the phrase, deadpan, is partly 
			hilarious and partly odd, though hardly as odd as the interview 
			itself. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">On its surface, 
			this interview is uninformative, nearly goofy. Suge will only answer 
			one question, essentially, which is to explain his &quot;message to the 
			kids.&quot; Seated on a bench in the yard, his bald head shiny with sweat 
			in the sun, big cigar in his mouth, he asserts his desires to help 
			the next generation, to warn them off of his own past: &quot;Peace 
			positive for the kids,&quot; he says.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Suge is 
			positioned here as the film's big get. In most of Broomfield's 
			films, this sort of hard-to-arrange interview serves as a climax -- 
			Aileen in her cell, Heidi in her dress shop, Courtney at the ACLU 
			Awards. Here, however, and for all his spectacular strangeness, Suge 
			is overshadowed at last by a return visit to Voletta. She cooks for 
			the crew, and then recalls a phone she once had with her son, where 
			he refused to get off -- for three hours -- until she forgave him 
			for something he had said or did (something she doesn't even 
			remember). The point is this desire for forgiveness, and the 
			generosity that Voletta not only embodies, but also recalls in her 
			son. She provides <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i> with welcome grace and 
			warmth. </font></span></p>
