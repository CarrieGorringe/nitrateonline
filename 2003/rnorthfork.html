            Hannah as hermaphrodyte angel. A strange and sublime concept,
            conjured by Mark and Michael Polish, it is also the perfect use of
            Hannah's long limbs and unusual angles. As Flower Hercules, with sad
            eyes, short black hair, and a gentle manner, Hannah brings a
            haunting and much welcome generosity to <i>Northfork</i>, the third
            installment of the brothers' &quot;American trilogy,&quot; after <i>Twin
            Falls Idaho</i> (1999) and <i>Jackpot</i> (2001). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            only one component in <i>Northfork</i>'s odd vista, Flower Hercules
            stands out, in part because s/he is not a man, in a film full of
            them, in pressed suits and ragged duress, by degrees frustrated,
            bristling, and conniving. Flower Hercules is also unusual among her
            crew of angels, the leader Cup of Tea (Robin Sachs), mute cowboy Cod
            (Ben Foster), and gadget-maker Happy (Anthony Edwards), with wooden
            hands and elaborately thick glasses. Compared to her edgy and
            distracted fellows, Flower Hercules is gracious and attentive. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            object of her focus is Irwin (Duel Farnes), a pasty, ailing orphan
            who floats in and out of restive dreams throughout the film, and who
            may or may not be imagining these angels as a way of saving himself.
            With bumps on his head that may have been caused by a halo and scars
            on his back that look like remnants of missing wings, Irwin has it
            in his head that he's an angel left behind by accident, looking to
            be reunited with relatives he never knew he had.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            desire is understandable, as Irwin's earthly existence is bereft of
            good news. At film's beginning, he's abandoned by his adoptive
            parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hadfield (Clark Gregg and Claire Forlani), who
            leave him with at a home with ravaged Father Harlan (Nick Nolte).
            The institution is ominously empty, as everyone else has also left
            town. The reason for their flight is the film's second major
            plot-point-as-metaphor (after, or in tandem with, the angels): it's
            1955, and Northfork, Montana is about to be flooded, owing to a
            spangly new hydroelectric dam. Everyone has been urged to move on,
            in the name of &quot;progress.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            its poetic, elusive way, <i>Northfork</i> takes up this notion of
            &quot;progress.&quot; For some, like Irwin and the Hadfields,
            impending events are disastrous. When the parents leave, uttering
            precious few lines between them, the child serves as the
            sympathetic, vulnerable, if somewhat mythic, individual; at the same
            time, the dam, along with its black-suited, narrow-tied
            representatives, become emblems of earnest industry and the future
            from which there is no turning back. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            action takes place during the last forty-eight hours before the
            flood. But it still moves deliberately, granting each separate scene
            its own frame, a beginning and end. The men go forth in pairs,
            &quot;Evacuation Teams&quot; who encourage residents to leave, with
            inducements including cash and their own motivation as well (they've
            been promised parcels of &quot;lakefront property&quot; following
            the deluge). One team is a father and son, Walter O'Brien (James
            Woods) and Willis (Mark Polish), who must also cope with the fact
            that the changing landscape necessitates digging up graves,
            including the one where Walter's wife is buried: &quot;When this
            small town becomes the biggest lake this side of the
            Mississippi,&quot; he tells Willis, &quot;your mother will be the
            catch of the day.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            of the Evacuators share a similarly offbeat sense of humor, though
            whether this derives from or is inspired by their work is hard to
            say. They begin their mission with inspiring instruction (&quot;Just
            go in like you're guardian angels&quot;), then ride in black Fords,
            across stark gray landscapes, each team assigned a recalcitrant
            holdout. Among these is one old man who's nailed himself to his
            porch and takes to shooting at his &quot;angels,&quot; but in such a
            lackadaisical way that both parties -- shooter and shootees -- end
            up falling asleep, waking with a start, to realize the futility of
            their disparate &quot;missions.&quot; Another is a man with two
            wives, who's refashioned his home as an ark, ready to float away
            when the waters come. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            fact, the film, like the other two by the identical twin Polish
            brothers, thematizes doubleness, in the two-man teams, two stories,
            two days before the flood. But it also finds difference in sameness,
            the layered pairings offering points of view that mirror but also
            refract one another. Most especially, Flower Hercules embodies a
            visible doubleness and quiet self-consciousness beyond typical
            understandings of individuality and movement. Much less interested
            in plot than in theme and image, <i>Northfork</i> imagines a journey
            without a clear end, along the way challenging, in particular, U.S.
            myths of enduring national identity, corporate good will, and
            westward-ho expansions. <o:p>
