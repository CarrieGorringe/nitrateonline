            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Budapest, the 1930s. Laszlo
            (Joachim Krol) likes Ilona (Erika Marozsan). She likes him, as well.
            That much is evident in an early scene where we see them in the bath
            together (that's &quot;bath&quot; as in &quot;tub&quot;). And it is
            a rather nice-looking tub, too, one of those large porcelain affairs
            with.... Anyway, Laszlo and Ilona are opening a new restaurant, and,
            rather than bring in the same old Hungarian Gypsy band to serenade
            the diners, they decide to hire a pianist. Enter András (Italian
            actor Stefano Dionisi). He likes Ilona, too. She likes him. She
            doesn't mind. Laszlo does. However, he decides that he would rather
            have half of Ilona than none at all.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film <i>Gloomy Sunday</i> has
            been likened by at least one source to <i>Jules and Jim</i>, only,
            as pretty and appealing as Erika Marozsan may be, she's not exactly
            Jeanne Moreau's Catherine, with that edge that made her both
            dangerous and tantalizing, and thus made you understand why both
            Oskar Werner and Henri Serre would go nuts for her. The lovers in <i>Gloomy
            Sunday</i> may be free-spirited, but the film itself, save for some
            instances where Marozsan is shown in some decorous states of
            undress, is a lot closer to more old-fashioned period romances, with
            their combination of love, betrayal, and high passion amid the clash
            of events. (The film's main title is underscored with the subtitle <i>A
            Song About Love and Death</i>.) And, as well, no sooner do Laszlo,
            Ilona and András settle into a comfy menage-a-trois than it
            produces an most unexpected progeny. András composes a little tune,
            which he plays for Ilona. It meets with her approval. Soon, people
            are flocking to the restaurant, not just for the food but to hear
            András' composition. A record deal is struck. Then, András hears
            about the five suicides that occurred in the last three days, all
            people who had just heard András' melody. And he hasn't even set
            lyrics to it, yet!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There actually was a song called <i>Gloomy
            Sunday</i>, written by two Hungarian songwriters in 1935, and it was
            an international hit (Billie Holliday was one of the first to record
            it in the U.S.); the songwriters also found themselves in the middle
            of some unexpected scandal when the press linked an inordinate
            number of suicides to people who had heard the song (the BBC even
            banned it for a time, except as an instrumental recording divorced
            from its disconsolate lyrics).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In the film, it comes off as nothing so much like a musical
            version of the chain letter in <i>Der Todesking</i>, something that
            makes everyone who comes in contact with it so despondent they chuck
            it all in. Soon, the body count has risen to 157 in 8 weeks, and a
            newsreel reports -- right after showing Hitler's armies pushing into
            western Europe -- that the song is running amuck through the
            countryside: a body at the foot of the Eiffel Tower is accompanied
            by an announcer saying, &quot;The tune's gruesome march across
            Europe continues...&quot;, after which it informs the audience that
            it has jumped the Atlantic and is causing Americans to put record
            players in the front seats of their Studebaker convertibles and
            drive straight into the drink while listening to András' melody.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Laszlo, Ilona and András no sooner
            get back from a much-needed picnic in the countryside to steady
            their nerves than their old German friend Hans (Ben Becker) turns
            up, only this time in an S.S. uniform. Laszlo is of Jewish decent,
            but Hans decides to protect him, if only because Laszlo's restaurant
            serves the best &quot;Magyar roulade&quot; -- a specially prepared
            meat dish, served rolled -- in town. Hans also likes Ilona, but he
            can never get past first-base with her -- he may call her a heavenly
            angel, but she replies, &quot;We heavenly ones tend to be rather
            conservative.&quot; This is just as well, since Hans turns out to be
            bilking all of Budapest's Jews out of their valuables, hoarding them
            in coffins (!) which he then seals and sends off to store for after
            the war. (Hans' biggest aspiration in life is to one day run a
            successful import and export business.) However, Hans makes the
            terrible mistake of crossing Ilona; he may<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>be rich, but this is the woman who had, as one character puts
            it, &quot;the song, you know which one&quot; written for her.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I would like to take all my
            baths in your tub,&quot; Ilona tells Laszlo, romantically, at one
            point. Do not let this stop you from seeing the picture, though.
            Filmed in burnished, gold-hued tones, it moves quite nimbly and
            never takes on the stiff, arid tone of many self-conscious
            &quot;prestige&quot; pictures, and while the characters (and
            filmmakers) never do manage to come up with a conclusive explanation
            as to what the &quot;message&quot; of the title song is (it's
            probably just as well that they didn't), the three lead characters
            turn out to be perfectly enjoyable ones to spend a few hours with. <i>Gloomy
            Sunday</i> opens and closes with a scene set at Laszlo's restaurant
            in modern-day Budapest, where the icy (or musical) hand of fate
            reaches out to.... Suffice to say that the movie has one more plot
            turn in store which I absolutely did not see coming, yet is
            satisfying in the way that an adroitly-executed surprise twist can
            be. (I am comparing this to, for instance, the fraudulent
            &quot;twist&quot; that was tacked onto the very end of a film that
            came out earlier this year, <i>The Life of David Gale</i>, which
            succeeded only in filling one up with animosity towards the movie
            while repudiating everything that had come before.) <i>Gloomy Sunday</i>
            also seems nostalgic for a vanished period in time, and for a type
            of filmmaking -- handsome, romantic, heart-tugging and unabashedly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>sentimental -- the type of filmmaking that makes you want to
            try some of Laszlo's rapturous <i>Magyar roulade</i> yourself.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>
