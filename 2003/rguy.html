            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>A Guy Thing</i>, Jason
            Lee, looking more ski-nosed than ever, plays Paul, a young Seattle
            man who's about to get married and wakes up, the morning after his
            bachelor party, to discover himself in bed with a strange woman.
            Selma Blair plays his intended, Karen, from whom he desperately
            tries to hide this fact. And Julia Stiles plays the strange girl,
            who's named Becky, takes the whole situation rather good-naturedly,
            but who then keeps bumping into Paul, over the next six days before
            his wedding, again and again and....</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An attempt to do a kooky romantic
            farce, the movie plays more like an episode of <i>Love, American
            Style</i> gone amuck, only with a newer cast and PG-13 material. It
            has sequences which will be truly talked about for months to come,
            such as the dinner with both sets of in-laws in attendance (plus a
            member of the clergy) where everyone gets higher than a kite from
            the pot that's been slipped into the gravy by the chef who's
            actually a drug store clerk who sold Paul some medication to get rid
            of a case of the c-r-a-b-s. Karen's parents (James Brolin and Diana
            Scarwid) are straightlaced<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">

            </i></b>although there's an incorrigible Irish aunt, played by the
            ubiquitous Canadian actress Jackie Burroughs, who gets to deliver
            the immortal line, &quot;I haven't had a bowel movement in 14
            days.&quot;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

            mortified, just mortified, to learn that Paul's mother (Julie
            Hagerty) and stepfather (David Koechner) think nothing of telling
            each other amusing double-entendres <i>out loud</i>. (So amusing, I
            can't remember a word of any of them.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            Lennon as if he were Tony Randall opposite Rock Hudson (only without
            all the implications Mark Rappaport mad apparent in his film <i>Rock
            Hudson's Home Movies</i>, though the filmmakers do manage to get
            some material of that nature into the movie through other means),
            openly yearns for Karen from scene one. Meanwhile, Stiles' Becky is
            shown to be an unconventional type who would be good for Paul
            because she can teach him how to really live by the fact that, one,
            she can't hold down a job for more than one day, and, two, when they
            break into the apartment of her ex-boyfriend to &quot;steal the
            negatives&quot; of some compromising photos, they end up getting
            trapped in a bathtub, cornered by the ex-boyfriend's ferocious mutt.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is a movie that leaves no
            barnacled cliché or hackneyed situational comedy device unmined.
            (It also presents Seattle as looking like the dankest city seen in
            any recent film this side of <i>Feardotcom</i>.) And this is the
            second new movie in two weeks to feature a &quot;psycho
            ex-boyfriend&quot;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            played by Lochlyn Munro, gets to punch Jason Lee to the ground,
            smash eggs on his head, and then pour a carton of chocolate milk all
            over him), and Paul gets to wear a wire so Internal Affairs can
            catch the guy when he does something like clamp his arm around
            Paul's neck in a &quot;death grip<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">.&quot;</i></b>
            (Strangely, Paul also wears the wire during the euphoric dinner
            scene, and nobody busts anybody for using an illegal substance. They
            must've been more concerned over what happened to the chocolate
            milk.)<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jason Lee still seems to be
            teetering on the edge of becoming, or not becoming, an actor of
            interest. Selma Blair, who gave a genuine breakthrough dramatic
            performance last year in <i>Storytelling</i>, here has to narrow her
            eyes and fume a lot (miraculously, she keeps her performance fresh,
            though). Julia Stiles, as Becky, shows great comedic ability and
            appeal, so much that you'd like to see her at-work in a better
            movie, pretty soon. And, in case you thought American screen comedy
            was dead, there's an extended sequence where a character has to
            feign diarrhea, bringing back fond memories of the scenes with Fat
            Bastard in last summer's <i>Austin Powers in Goldmember</i>. By all
            means, go see the movie<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
