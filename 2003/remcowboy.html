            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory
            Avery</a>, 19 September 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Emerald Cowboy</i> purports
            to tell the story of Eishy Hayata, born in Tokyo, raised in Los
            Angeles, and who went to Colombia in the 1970s, slapped a cowboy hat
            on his head, and became an <i>esmeraldero</i>, independently buying
            rough emeralds in open-air markets or from miners or anyone who digs
            them out of the ground, purchasing them with ready cash. Twenty-five
            years later, he is the successful head of a large emerald company in
            Bogota, probably one of the most dangerous places in the world to be
            living and doing any sort of business in, let alone trading in
            precious stones, and Hayata is seen coming and going with no less
            than nine bodyguards at a time to prove it.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hayata, in the flashbacks, is
            played by an actor who is much taller than him and looks a lot
            different. Hayata plays himself in the scenes set in the present day
            and in the 1990s, when an attempt was made to literally force him
            out of business because, among other things, he's a
            &quot;foreigner&quot; (something that is never mentioned by anyone
            until two-thirds of the film is over with). The flashbacks are
            filmed in conventional mode (and the film itself was made on
            location, in Bogota and in Colombia's mountainous regions), and
            none, absolutely none of the actors or persons who appear in these
            scenes are credited in the film's end credits. The modern day scenes
            are lensed in a wobbly, handheld style, with brackish colors. This
            is of no particular help, since Hayata is not an actor and is also
            not a particularly pleasant man to look at, having the screen
            presence of an unpolished block of granite.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hayata receives sole credit for the
            film's screenplay, and co-directed the picture with Andrew Molina.
            Some of the stiffness in the action and dialogue may have been
            intentional, to give the picture a &quot;realistic&quot; quality.
            However, just showing some people dickering over the price of uncut
            stones does not give us a full idea of what the emerald trade is
            like or how Hayata became a gem merchant. Nor does showing his
            Colombian-born wife, sent to Los Angeles to raise their three
            children, calling him long distance to complain (&quot;I don't have
            any life here!&quot;) give us an idea of what his private life was
            like. (He sensitively responds, &quot;I don't have a minute to f**k
            around with any whore!&quot; And, besides, there's no P.T.A. or
            volunteer services in Los Angeles that she can become involved in?)
            And yet, he is shown standing up to people with guns and telling
            them that he is the &quot;heart of Colombia&quot; (though he also
            wears a bullet-proof vest in to work every morning). Then, before
            you can say &quot;vanity production&quot;, or anything else for that
            matter, an epilogue informs us that, in 2002, Hayata was shot, and
            &quot;is in critical condition, fighting to survive a coma at a
            hospital in the United States&quot;[sic].<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Barbet Schroeder's recent film, <i>Our
            Lady of the Assassins</i>, made on digital video in Medellin (where
            Schroeder spent part of his youth), showed how harrowing and
            hair-trigger (and strangely exhilarating) day-to-day existence in
            Colombia could be. There's probably a good story to be told in the
            events that make up <i>Emerald Cowboy</i>, but it hasn't been nearly
            brought to the fore.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
