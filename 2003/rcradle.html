			<font size="2">X gon' give it to ya. Deemed &quot;The Next Tom Cruise&quot; by 
			no less an authority than <i>GQ</i> magazine, the prolific, 
			asthmatic, and charismatic Dark Man X continues to power his way 
			into the movies. In <i>Cradle 2 the Grave</i>, he plays Tony Fait, 
			thief extraordinaire, introduced mid-heist. He and his partners -- 
			Daria (Gabrielle Union), Miles (Drag-On, X's Ruff Ryders associate), 
			and Tommy (the irrepressible Anthony Anderson) -- break into a 
			diamond exchange, armed with the latest in cutting-and-piercing 
			laser-gizmos and form-fitting black t-shirts. All this under 
			Eminem's rousing &quot;Go To Sleep&quot;: &quot;I ain't gonna eat / I ain't gonna 
			sleep / Ain't gonna breathe, til I see, what I wanna see.&quot; </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same 
			time, Su (Jet Li) makes a stunning entrance. He positions himself on 
			a high-rise hotel rooftop, then proceeds to drop from floor to 
			floor, grabbing successive balcony ledges with his fingertips. When 
			he reaches the floor he wants, he smashes through the window, then 
			deftly brutalizes his mark into giving up the heist location. The 
			whole business takes a couple of minutes. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As action-buddy 
			movie aficionados will surmise, this speedy split-intro means that 
			Tony and Su will be working together, soon. And indeed, even as Su 
			cruises to the crime-in-progress scene, he takes a moment to call 
			his seeming adversary, warning him to get out, as he's also called 
			in L.A. SWAT. Also no surprise, this apparent good sportsmanship 
			stems from Su's ulterior motives. He's a Taiwanese Intelligence 
			officer looking to recover the very same black diamonds that Tony 
			and crew are pilfering. As he later tells Tony, these diamonds 
			&quot;aren't what you think they are&quot; (though again, any action-buddy 
			move fan worth her salt has already guessed that much).&nbsp; </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Tony, being a 
			cocky sort who resents being told what to do (a point which will be 
			made again and again, and again), grabs up his crew and the 
			diamonds, plus a special teardrop diamond necklace for his beloved 
			six-year-old daughter Vanessa (Paige Hurd), and escapes. Or, at 
			least he does until he's hunted down, first by Su, and then by Su's 
			own special enemies, the sinister Ling (Mark Dacascos, amazing in <i>
			Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>, here only revealing his skills in a big 
			dealio &quot;ring of fire&quot; showdown with Li) and his forever fuming 
			henchgirl Sona (Kelly Hu). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When these 
			scoundrels kidnap Vanessa (a refreshingly resourceful victim), the 
			film's many intersecting but mostly arbitrary subplots start kicking 
			in. For one, Tony and Su visit a crime-boss named Chambers (Chi 
			McBride with fat cigar) in prison, whereupon you learn that Tony 
			enticed Daria away from Chambers, who sustains a major grudge. &quot;It's 
			my little girl,&quot; Tony pleads. &quot;So make another one,&quot; sneers the big 
			meanie. (Per formula, it's only a matter of time before this 
			Suge-ish guy gets his.) </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In another 
			subplot scene, Daria is dispatched to distract Chambers' 
			club-managing minion, Odion (<i>The Shield</i>'s Michael Jace), who 
			looks mighty distracting himself, in his black velvet jacket and 
			deep red shirt. She strips down to red underwear, while Tommy plays 
			a bugman. Literally: he pretends to be an exterminator, oldest trick 
			in the damn book. And this inane ruse bothers him less than playing 
			sexual-object distraction for a male security guard earlier in the 
			film. Let's just say that the gay flirt-bugman range doesn't exactly 
			stretch Anderson's considerable talents.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But he's only 
			along for a ride here. The third kung-fu-hiphop one-two punch by 
			Bartkowiak, <i>Cradle 2 the Grave</i> is also the second time he's 
			worked with Li, who is reliably cool (their first film together was
			<i>Romeo Must Die</i> [2000], which also featured DMX for a minute). 
			Su has a &quot;unique fighting style,&quot; conceived for the film by Li and 
			endlessly inventive Corey Yuen, so brilliant and self-assured that 
			he can beat back challengers with one hand in his pocket. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Li often takes 
			on rooms full of big-bodied blowhards. Here, he does so during a 
			notably incongruous set piece in an Ultimate Fighting Club, where he 
			confronts real-life UFC champions Randy &quot;The Natural&quot; Coture, Tito 
			Ortiz, and Chick Liddell. The battle over-stimulates the 
			bloodthirsty in-house audience, giving the movie audience a standard 
			double chance: you can scorn these losers and also share in their 
			excitement. They roar and sputter, hang on the cage, burst out of 
			their blouses if they are women, and wave fistfuls of cash and beer 
			bottle, as such bloodthirsty audiences are wont to do. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">One member of 
			this audience is Tony's fence, Archie (Tom Arnold, another 
			Bartkowiak veteran, from <i>Exit Wounds</i> (2001), which also 
			featured DMX, in a slightly larger role than in <i>Romeo</i>, as 
			well as Anderson: the reunion omits Steven Seagal, otherwise engaged 
			these days, presumably with his many court dates). Su and Archie 
			make a strange yet familiar team. The former is as fast on his feet 
			as the latter is prodigiously motor-mouthed. (Archie is the only one 
			of Tony's associates able to identify Su's badge; when Tony is 
			impressed that he reads Chinese, Archie demurs, &quot;I don't, but I read 
			'cop' in any language.&quot;) It appears that Su and Archie emulate 
			something of the dynamic that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker offer in 
			the <i>Rush Hour</i>s, except that Li doesn't use refrigerators or 
			ladders as props, and Tom Arnold is... well, he's Tom Arnold.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Archie and Su's 
			teaming also allows Tony some time alone. He puts this to use by 
			fighting a little, fretting a little, getting arrested, then 
			escaping the cops in flamboyant style, namely, by riding all over 
			town -- most spectacularly, leaping from rooftop to rooftop -- on an 
			All Terrain Vehicle. It's no small thing that driving ATVs is 
			reportedly one of DMX's favorite off-camera pastimes, for it 
			suggests that the script is accommodating the star's disposition.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It hardly 
			matters whether this disposition is substantive or a function of 
			marketing. The point is that DMX, rowdy and respected MC, is now 
			being treated by filmmakers -- Bartkowiak, producer Joel Silver -- 
			as an important commodity, a name brand. Surely, ever since his 
			breakout as Tommy in Hype Williams' <i>Belly</i> (1998), DMX has 
			been headed in this direction. And, he has a particular sense of his 
			own strengths. He's not been so loosey-goosey about his role choices 
			as Ice T (<i>Frankenpenis</i>, <i>Leprechaun in the Hood</i>), so 
			determined to be a bona fide actor as P. Diddy (<i>Monster's Ball</i>,
			<i>Made</i>), or so conscientiously entrepreneurial as Master P (<i>Foolish</i>,
			<i>Lockdown</i>). Instead, he has selected parts built for him, his 
			crossover rough-but-also-upright demeanor, with added martial arts 
			for his hiphop fanbase. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Now that he's 
			worked his way into a starring role and announced his retirement 
			from music (citing the intrinsic, invincible unfairness of the 
			industry's treatment of artists), DMX is concentrating on movies. 
			This entails, as the <i>GQ</i> article notes, adjusting to a new 
			culture (where time is quite precisely money). The magazine, in 
			fact, shifts its point from cover to story: its declarative cover 
			caption (&quot;DMX is the next Tom Cruise&quot;) turns into a question inside 
			(&quot;Is DMX the next Tom Cruise?&quot;). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">DMX's notorious 
			decency, hard childhood, and commitment to his family ground his 
			resistance to L.A.'s customary codes of behavior (&quot;I'm not kissing 
			no f*ckin' ass&quot;). More power to him. He not only expects mutual 
			respect, but he also brings obvious appeal and incipient 
			superstardom (the man single-handedly resurrected Seagal's career, 
			briefly). Perhaps it's more helpful to ask, what does it mean for a 
			hiphop artist with street and jail time behind him, a black man 
			publicly down for his community -- however talented, however adored 
			-- to be called &quot;the next Tom Cruise&quot;? Does this signal an actual 
			change in the way Hollywood, and by extension, the U.S. 
			entertainment industry, does business? or does it mean more of the 
			same, more exploitation, more pain? Will DMX soon be headlining a 
			multi-bijillion dollar franchise like the <i>Mission Impossible</i>s? 
			Will his production company be able to finance such major league 
			projects? </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Granted, <i>
			From Cradle 2 the Grave</i>, a B-movie even if it does boast some 
			A-movie stunts, can't begin to answer these broad, industry-shaking 
			questions. But they're provocative questions. And it's encouraging 
			that they might even be asked. </font></span></td>
