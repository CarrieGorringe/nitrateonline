			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 7 February 2003</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Final Destination 2</i>, A.J. 
			Cook plays a teenaged girl, Kimberly, who can't even go on a simple 
			road trip with her friends from New York State to Daytona Beach 
			without upsetting Death's Grand Scheme -- in this case, a 
			spectacular multi-vehicle pile-up which, almost, gets the film off 
			to a rousing start (until the filmmakers goof the very end of the 
			sequence). Kimberly &quot;sees&quot; the accident, and who is to perish in it, 
			before making a turn onto the freeway, and takes appropriate action 
			to save their lives. But should they feel good, if not, dare I say 
			it, ENJOY the miracle of being alive? Nooooooooo. Instead, everyone 
			knows they were supposed to buy it, and you feel like giving them 
			all, well, a good talking-to, in the least.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The evocative, 
			even moving, skein of manifest guilt and loss that was in the 2000 
			film, <i>Final Destination</i> -- a movie which was a case of the 
			right people coming together with the right material at the right 
			time -- has been replaced by having the new film rely solely on the 
			characters having eluded their appointment with Death, turning it 
			into a kind of existential stalker picture. Along with Kimberly, the 
			eluders include a lottery winner (David Paetkau) whom Death seems to 
			have marked because he has bad taste in jewelry and watches; a woman 
			(Lynda Boyd) and her son (James N. Kirk), who, after learning they 
			&quot;cheated Death&quot;, tramp off to the dentist's office; a cynical 
			teacher (T.C. Carson); a young woman in a business dress suit 
			(Keegan Connor Tracy, who could be a, ahem, dead ringer for Juliette 
			Lewis); a scuzzy druggie (Jonathan Cherry); and a police officer 
			with sympathetic eyes (Michael Landes). That's how interested the 
			film is in giving the characters any sort of definition. After a 
			couple of sequences where it looks like we're going to see the 
			characters meeting their fates with the unfolding methodical nature 
			of the same such scenes in a Dario Argento movie (although without 
			Argento's style and panache), the picture sinks into total confusion 
			when it introduces the idea that Death's &quot;tying up loose ends&quot; can 
			be averted by the introduction of &quot;new life&quot;, which would, 
			apparently, cause Death to throw a shoe and stop messing around with 
			these people. That leads to a hunt for a woman (Justina Machado, who 
			provides the film with its one really good moment, near the end) 
			who's about to have a baby -- &quot;Could we find the pregnant woman now, 
			please?&quot; one shivering character asks -- and a scene where Kimberly 
			realizes that she made a mistake and the only way to rectify things 
			is by driving an ambulance into a lake (said lake being located 
			conveniently close to a hospital -- just like the dentist's office 
			two of the characters go to has nice, big, plate glass windows 
			facing a construction site).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film provides 
			contemptuous explanations of what happened to the two lead 
			characters in the last film, played by Devon Sawa and Ali Larter -- 
			the talented Larter is brought back for this film to reprise her 
			character, who checked herself into a psychiatric hospital so that 
			she can safely reside in a padded cell, then quickly checks herself 
			back out again. Tony Todd, also in the previous film, returns to do 
			his oogity-boogity bit in one scene, where he gleefully yanks a 
			nipple ring off a corpse with a pair of pliers before performing a 
			cremation. Yankings and blastings and crashings and flattenings are 
			all right, but you need some sort of credibility to keep the 
			audience with you -- otherwise, they roll their eyes and risk 
			venting their wrath. The screenplay for <i>Final Destination 2</i> 
			that was cooked up by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress includes such 
			things as characters shrieking warnings like, &quot;A man with hooks is 
			going to kill you!&quot; And the closing credits song, meant to send us 
			on our merry way, has the lyric, &quot;My name is Death,/ Come taste my 
			peppermint-laced breath.&quot; Maybe later, brother.</font></p>
