            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Theater director Jim Simpson
            takes very few risks in his cinematic adaptation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Guys</i>, Anne Nelson’s celebrated two-person play about a
            journalist helping a NYC fire captain write eulogies for the men he
            lost in the World Trade Center on 9/11, and the film suffers as a
            result of his caution. Shot with a detached, economical precision
            that infuses the drama with an awkward tentativeness, the film, more
            often than not, feels unsure of how to confront its subject matter.
            One can sense Simpson’s hesitation to plunge headfirst into
            examining the damaged psyche of Nick, a captain wracked by
            survivor’s guilt, and his unlikely partner Joan, a writer whose
            time with the firefighter allows her to confront her own feelings of
            powerlessness and despair. Simpson packs his film with unspectacular
            close-ups and two-shots set in the kitchen and living room of
            Joan’s perfectly-maintained Upper West Side apartment; his camera,
            instead of intimately probing his characters’ rage, frustration,
            and misery, remains nothing more than a passive observer. With the
            exception of a few poignant excursions out onto the bloodied and
            battered streets of New York City, this leaden visual storytelling
            winds up simply revealing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sigourney Weaver and Anthony
            LaPaglia star as Joan and Nick, and these veteran performers -- who
            spent considerable time last year portraying these characters on the
            stage -- bring a lived-in familiarity to the roles. Weaver’s Joan
            is a successful journalist who, in her youthful days, spent time in
            Latin American reporting on the most dangerous revolutionary events
            she could find. Now living a safe, quiet life ensconced in her
            affluent Manhattan abode with her husband and two children, Joan no
            longer feels intimately connected to the material she writes about
            on her word processor. When a friend asks her to help Nick construct
            his tributes, it’s as though Joan has discovered a way to become
            emotionally involved in the story that every New Yorker -- just by
            reporting their safety to loved ones, friends, and colleagues -- has
            been forced to accept as their own.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Arriving at Joan’s apartment,
            Nick is devastated. His slumped body language, warily jumpy eyes,
            and curt, slightly wavering speech reflect a man whose life has been
            stripped bare. Eight men under his command were lost on that fateful
            day, but Nick can’t seem to get any of his memories out on paper.
            What he does know is that his fallen comrades were just regular guys
            doing their duty the best they knew how, rather than the saintly
            heroes that he hears about on television. Nick is determined to
            speak about the men he knew -- the rookie only a few weeks on the
            job, the commanding senior officer everyone looked up to, the
            wisecracking comedian, and the inspirational leader who was his best
            friend -- without overblown proclamations about their noble
            sacrifice.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
            Guys</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> can hardly be faulted
            for its decision to confront 9/11 on an individual, rather than a
            sweeping historical, scale. But once the film’s predictable
            pattern has been established -- Nick reluctantly begins remembering
            one of his colleagues, Joan coaxes more information out of him about
            each guy, Joan types up the eulogy and Nick reads it aloud, and then
            Joan tries to sort through her thoughts about 9/11 at her laptop
            before the cycle begins anew -- Simpson and Nelson’s tidy
            screenplay begins to lose a much-needed sense of urgency and
            surprise. The repetitiveness of this structure doesn’t completely
            hinder our ability to sympathize with Nick (only a callous soul
            could feel no sorrow while watching him struggle through this
            torturous process) but it does sabotage any dramatic momentum the
            film might have. Rather than building toward a revelatory climax,
            the film merely duplicates itself by recounting further stories of
            lives cut tragically short.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not to say that the film’s
            narrative monotony isn’t occasionally interrupted by images and
            scenes of tender, insightful grace. As Joan sits at her computer
            trying to make sense of the attacks (words being the only tool she
            has at her disposal), we hear her thoughts in voice-over as her
            prose -- white letters against a black background -- literally
            appears on screen. This blunt presentation of her thoughts ("Are you
            OK?" "When do we go back to normal?" "I know you absorb some of the
            toxins listening to the pain") not only conveys the rawness and
            desperation of Joan’s laments, but also compels the audience to
            examine their own feelings of guilt, loss, and anger. Joan and Nick
            are searching for a "reason" that so many lives were lost in
            9/11’s sudden flash of light, fire, and rubble, and the appearance
            of Joan’s words implicates us in this pursuit for answers.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, there are no easy
            answers, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Guys</i>
            wisely doesn’t try to posit any. At one point in their talks, Nick
            reveals that he has spent years learning to dance. Before we know
            it, he’s holding Joan in his arms, guiding her through a tender
            tango around the living room. The scene, as Joan quickly reveals to
            us, never happened except in her mind’s eye. But what this
            imaginative diversion represents is something <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Guys</i> all too frequently tells, rather than shows, its audience:
            how two people from different worlds can discover common ground, and
            survive by finding a sturdy shoulder to lean on.</font></td>
