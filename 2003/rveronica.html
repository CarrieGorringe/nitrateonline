            Irish Sunday-Independent journalist Veronica Guerin was assassinated
            in Dublin in 1996, victim of the drug traffickers she threatened to
            expose, the world sat up and took notice. Ireland, plagued by
            poverty and by a criminal element intent upon exploiting and preying
            upon their poorer brethren, was in the midst of one of the worst
            drug sieges in its famine-riddled history. Some fifteen thousand a
            day shot heroin; eight kids under the age of fifteen died in one
            neighborhood alone - all in short order. The bottom-feeders who made
            a profit from this miserable plight held no guilt, no remorse - only
            the desire to reap the bounty at any price.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Veronica
            Guerin, whose life has also been chronicled on film in <i>When the
            Sky Falls</i>, which starred Joan Allen, and who received mention in
            John Boorman¹s powerful movie about Martin Cahill, <i>The General</i>,
            changed Ireland¹s lackadaisical drug laws. But it took her death to
            do it. Director Joel Schumacher, who initially seems too Hollywood
            polish to pull off such a charged crusader story - unless you recall
            the political bent of his films <i>Tigerland </i>and <i>Falling Down</i>
            (and overlook the populist histrionics of <i>Dying Young</i> and <i>St.
            Elmo¹s Fire</i>) - does it on the straight and narrow in this Jerry
            Bruckheimer-produced film.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It¹s
            an arthouse attempt at legitimacy for Bruckheimer, who is better
            known for action and war fare. <i>Veronica Guerin</i> is a gritty,
            smart, tumultuous telling of Guerin¹s pugnacious pluck and courage
            - a force that gave her a radiance and seductive charm which
            ingratiated her to some of her underworld snitches and sources.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cate
            Blanchett¹s in the lead as Veronica Guerin, a tireless, relentless
            woman with a devoted husband, son and mother - and a gaggle of
            newspaper associates who either hate, love or envy her tough style
            and ability to ferociously go where no other reporter would dare
            venture.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Guerin,
            tired of writing the female fashion story, &quot;wants to make a
            difference&quot; once she glimpses the dire straits of Dublin¹s
            mean streets firsthand: toddlers¹ toys consist of broken, diseased
            syringes that litter the loins of the filthy slums. Mothers suckle
            their infants while shooting up; a stench and vomit-stained, burned
            out squat is visited daily by pushers - just long enough for their
            gleaming new Mercedes to catch a hint of dust and who work for John
            Gilligan (Gerard McSorley). In synchronized rotation they peel five
            pound notes off each lost soul dying for a daily fix. &quot;How many
            five pound notes do you have to get to get a new Mercedes?&quot;
            cracks Guerin.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            John Gilligan is a dead dangerous silent man pulling the strings
            behind a drape of betrayals and butchery. He¹s a wizard of odds who
            wants to remain a behind-the-scenes enigma. Veronica, tired of being
            led down clue cul-de-sacs and weary of chasing the wrong criminals
            meets her match in this ex-con thug who fancies himself a
            sophisticate but instead is an immoral, bloated murderer who thinks
            nothing of dispensing rivals like &quot;General&quot; Martin Cahill,
            whom he orders shot to death in front of his own house. The
            &quot;c--t&quot; reporter Guerin, who threatens his lavish
            lifestyle, is a thorn in his side.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blanchett
            brings a ferocity that is formidable to Veronica, as well as a
            playful spunk and lifeforce that sometimes chills with its
            narrow-mindedness. Her seductive play with John &quot;The
            Coach&quot; Traynor (Ciaran Hinds), a pimp who is tied to Gilligan
            and feeds Veronica her leads - is fearlessly brazen. Blanchett is,
            as always, the film¹s anchor and keel, keeping its dark digressions
            into the drug netherworld on course with her abilty to inhabit
            Guerin, not simply act her. As playful a mother, daughter and wife
            as she is a stalwart reporter, she never allows affection to stand
            in the way of her campaign. Blanchett isn¹t afraid to play Guerin
            as a sometimes selfish, self-centered. sloppily loving woman who is
            immersed in finding the truth - to the slight of her family¹s well
            being. Yet Blanchett¹s intelligence keeps us hanging in there over
            a character who is, in her ambitious quest, often less than
            sympathetic.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schumacher
            instills a pervasive sense of dread into Veronica¹s reckless
            crusade. Because we¹re enticed and admire her pluck we wait,
            worried and nearly nauseous, knowing some violence will be
            inflicted. Inflicted it is in a wrenching scene when she negligently
            corners Gilligan in his own backyard and he beats her with
            unflinching hatred and fear, violating her safety in a way that
            curdles our stomachs because the stench of that hate and fear is
            palpably real. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            the film is not without its heart. One aching scene shows Veronica¹s
            lovingly no-nonsense mother Bernie (Brenda Fricker) walking with her
            grandson. He spies mom on the side of the metro bus: &quot;A life
            under threat,&quot; it reads, next to a blow-up of Veronica who,
            having survived a bullet in the leg, has become a celebrity in her
            own right. The sadness of the inevitable crosses Fricker¹s face: it¹s
            a moment of supreme portent and omen, a realization of things to
            come, crimped with the pain over the fact that those who love Guerin
            are still powerless to stop this martyr in the making.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Veronica
            Guerin</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            is never preachy in its pilgrimage. It is lean and spare in style,
            trimmed down from the fat of usual Bruckeimer indulgences to the
            most pragmatic and determined simplicity. It is more an homage to
            the tough journalists it honors - and because Blanchett¹s ego never
            gets in the way of her sublime talent the film has the visual and
            visceral mettle of a documentary, which is the biggest compliment it
            can be paid.<o:p>
