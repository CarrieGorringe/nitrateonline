            three of the best actors in business and leaves viewers with a warm
            fuzzy feeling. Curiously the film quickly fades from memory like one
            of those disposable DVDs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            film features some gorgeous cinematography from Jack N. Green (<i>Unforgiven</i>)
            and a script by its director Tim McCanlies, who wrote the charmingly
            clever animated adaptation of <i>The Iron Giant</i>. Because it
            never quite reaches its enormous potential, <i>Secondhand Lions</i>
            feels like a disappointment even though there's much to praise.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The idea of casting Sir Michael
            Caine and the All-American Robert Duvall as eccentric brothers named
            Garth and Hub seems a bit of a stretch, but the two do have nicely
            complementary acting styles. Both are low-key performers who can do
            more with a shrug or a glance than most other performers do with
            volumes of dialogue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their characters are two reclusive
            fellows that all of people in the nearby Texas town talk about but
            none really know. The only thing anyone seems to ascertain about
            them is that they're rich. Blindly hopeful salesmen ignore their
            copious warning signs only to find their cars riddled with bullets
            courtesy of the privacy-loving siblings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their lead-enforced solitude is
            broken when their Machiavellian niece Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) unloads
            her reluctant son Walter (Haley Joel Osment) on them. Before they
            can refuse, she skips town and even leaves the lad a phony
            forwarding address, sticking them with him indefinitely.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite their odd habits (the two
            don't own a TV, and Hub sleepwalks), they quickly take to Walter
            because he's their only relative who isn't after their money. Garth
            even lets the lad in on their adventurous past. Walter isn't sure
            how much to believe, but it makes more sense than the rumors he's
            heard from the folks in town. These flashbacks are shot in a
            cartoonish manner that matches the way a kid like Walter would
            imagine them. The film's humor generally works. One scene that seems
            to stick in the mind: when a lion Garth and Hub have bought for an
            attempted safari proves to be an indifferent prey, so the three make
            it a pet.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">McAnlies loads the film with a
            gooey sentimentality that quickly gets old. The heavy-handed
            manipulation is particularly unwelcome toward the end, although
            Caine's light touch helps. He seems to get more interesting with
            age, finding subtle flourishes that make a simple reaction shot
            mesmerizing. Because his own Cockney drawl is so familiar, Caine's
            reasonably convincing Texas accent takes some getting used to.
            Duvall expectedly has an easier time in that department and makes
            the most of his showier role.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With such intimidating company,
            Osment holds his own nicely. Despite his impressive track record,
            it's still astonishing how this young guy can convey complicated
            emotions so effortlessly.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At times watching the three of them
            in <i>Secondhand Lions</i> is about like listening to the Three
            Tenors breaking into pop tunes. It might not sound too bad, but
            their virtuosity might have been better served with more ageless and
            memorable material.</font></td>
