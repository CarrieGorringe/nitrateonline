            is good for U.S. Army Specialist Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix). Or
            more precisely, as good as it can be, considering that he's an
            ex-con, more or less conscripted by the military for service with
            the 317th Battalion at a base outside Stuttgart in 1989. Bored and
            cynical, he sells contraband -- everything from Mop 'n' Glo and
            cigarettes to heroin and weapons. Observing his fellow soldiers
            engaged in an indoor football game, he describes them as products of
            a depleted, post-Vietnam War military, a crew of &quot;prisoners and
            high school dropouts trained to kill,&quot; unfocused and unhappy.
            &quot;These were my guys,&quot; Elwood says, with &quot;nothing to
            kill but time.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">With
            that, one of his guys reaches for a pass and falls against a table,
            smashing his skull. As the others argue over the play, Elwood checks
            the kid's pulse and finds him dead. Shoot. Though, as Elwood knows,
            there will be &quot;no hero's burial&quot; for this &quot;f*cked up
            junkie,&quot; he has to go through the motions, and help the
            nice-enough but clueless CO, Colonel Berman (Ed Harris), write a
            letter to the parents. (That Elwood is secretly bedding Berman's
            wife [Elizabeth McGovern] isn't so much cruel or even funny as it is
            another sign of the lack of interest anyone takes in anything here.)
            When Elwood observes that the letter's phrasing sounds excessive,
            Berman backs off fast: &quot;Scratch 'resplendent.' Don't let that
            word leave this base!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Such
            mordant details help make <i>Buffalo Soldiers</i> a satire in the
            vein of <i>M*A*S*H*</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> or <i>Catch-22</i>. <i>Buffalo
            Soldiers</i> smartly taps into its moment (it ends as the Berlin
            Wall falls), particularly through David Holmes' evocative score, and
            tracks from Public Enemy (&quot;1989!!&quot;), New Order, and the
            Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. And, like its precursors, it takes
            darkly comedic aim at U.S. military bureaucracy and ideological
            muddles, the endless and appalling ways that plans -- grand or
            lesser -- go wrong. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">These
            errors are revealed here to be functions of tedium, the efforts by
            frustrated human beings to feel something other than oppression and
            ennui, to feel some sense of self-control, however bogus or fleeting
            (as Elwood puts it, &quot;War is hell, but peace is f*cking
            boring&quot;). Weary of being told what to think and how to behave
            at every turn, they rebel in trivial but telling ways, more often
            than not imitating the very systems they think they're bucking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">While
            this insight is not precisely news, it's worth repeating, perhaps
            particularly when the military is in very loud self-vaunting mode.
            That wasn't the case when the film was first set to be released: its
            film festival premiere was 7 September 2001. Four days later,
            Miramax started rescheduling, allegedly looking for a time when <i>Buffalo
            Soldiers</i>' send-up wouldn't seem so &quot;unpatriotic.&quot; It's
            possible that this moment has still not arrived: as ABC News
            reporter Jeffrey Kofman knows too well, suggesting that the U.S.
            military is less than committed to its duty every waking minute
            might get you outed as gay, Canadian, or both. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still,
            <i>Buffalo Soldiers</i> makes an often witty, sometimes overkilled
            case that the military is designed to incite hostilities and
            rivalries with a series of escalating contests on the U.S. base.
            Elwood's arrogant challenges to any visible form of authority are
            obvious. More subtly, the hierarchy depends on insecurity and Berman
            and his wife believe that he'll finally get the promotion he covets
            if he can: a) impress a General Lancaster (Dean Stockwell) with
            proof he's descended from some historical soldier called the Iron
            Boar, and b) lead his team to a win a military exercise. (No
            surprise: neither approach works, and, as Elwood perceives, Berman
            is too decent to succeed in the military.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Perhaps
            most striking in this general thematic context is Elwood's recurring
            nightmare, in which he's falling. It's not just any kind of falling
            -- he falls from a plane, a bomb himself, plummeting toward earth in
            an all-destructive whoosh, not really meaning to wreak horror and
            havoc, but, well, that's what bombs do. It's not clear that he
            recognizes his responsibility for any of the chaos he brings, as an
            individual or as he is affiliated with the U.S. military. But his
            fear of falling -- in whatever metaphorical sense you want to read
            it -- is undeniable. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">On
            this tip, the film reaches back as well, not so much to claim a
            legacy as to reveal and critique one. On this level, the film is
            about its title: the original Buffalo Soldiers were black soldiers
            serving the U.S. Army following the Civil War (many had also served
            during the War), in a program initiated in 1866. Nicknamed by their
            ostensible opponents, the Cheyenne and Comanche, these units
            typically endured the worst possible assignments, as well as
            prejudice in and out of the military. According to Jordan's film,
            the soldiers serving after the Vietnam War were not volunteers in a
            conventional sense -- they were the &quot;dregs&quot; of society,
            only willing to &quot;enlist&quot; in order to be paroled, from
            prison or otherwise desperate circumstances of their lives
            (&quot;Vietnam,&quot; says Elwood, &quot;was the thorn in
            everybody's side&quot;). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            Australian director Gregor Jordan (whose <i>Two Hands</i> [1999] is
            a cleverly put-together neo-noir, starring Bryan Brown and a very
            young Heath Ledger) has something else in mind, beyond a particular
            charge against the impracticable structure of the U.S. military. For
            him, the film (adapted from Robert O'Connor's novel) offers a
            broader indictment -- of human tendencies to violence, and
            especially, typical masculine tendencies to aggressive competition.
            Even during ostensible peacetime (for instance, the Cold War), the
            film proposes, soldiers look for battles to fight. Young Elwood's
            chief adversary turns out to be &quot;one of his own,&quot; the new
            Top Sergeant, Vietnam War veteran Robert K. Lee (Scott Glenn), who
            seems willing to undertake any sort of illegal means to stop
            Elwood's illegal activities. In other words, their pathologies are
            well matched. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            dick-measuring contest lurches to other levels with two plot events:
            first, Elwood and his black market partners, Garcia (Michael Pena)
            and Stoney (Leon Robinson), come across a cache of weapons. (That
            is, a tank manned by troops high on heroin drives into downtown
            service station's gas tanks, resulting in explosions and
            wide-ranging disaster, leaving a weapons transport driverless and
            available for the taking.) This fortuitous find escalates the scale
            of traffic, as previously, their biggest moneymaker was the heroin
            they cooked to be distributed by scary MP Saad (Sheik Mahmud-Bey).
            Of course, such large scale product also steps up the penalties, if
            they're busted. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            second turn is only nominally more &quot;personal,&quot; in that
            Elwood decides to &quot;date&quot; Lee's daughter, Robyn (Anna
            Paquin), precisely to mess with her father. On hearing this, she
            rightly concludes, &quot;That's definitely f*cked up!&quot; but kind
            of likes the idea too, because she hates her dad too. Lee responds
            to Elwood's cheek with venom: he attacks Stoney repeatedly (at one
            point, he asks him, &quot;Aren't you sick of being f*cked by a white
            man?&quot; Indeed). And, on seeing Robyn emerge from Elwood's BMW,
            he hauls the car out to the shooting range the next morning, and has
            Elwood and his squad fire at it until it collapses in smoke. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Elwood's
            dispute with Lee folds into the larger, emblematic media event of
            the Berlin Wall's destruction, which is pictured on a television set
            that's fallen on its side. As the world around them is changing
            forever, these soldiers are so wrapped up inside their own narrow
            visions, their own self-devised struggles, that they can't see
            what's in front of them. In its own time, <i>Buffalo Soldiers</i>
            exposes how out of sync history and morality can be. <o:p>
