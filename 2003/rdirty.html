            she makes her way through the hotel foyer, Juliette (Sophie Okonedo)
            waves goodnight to Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the desk clerk. Their
            brief exchange takes mere seconds, but their eyes -- weary, knowing
            -- convey a deeply felt, shared experience. Immigrants struggling to
            live in London, they're night people, toiling when most everyone
            else, save for Juliette's clients, is sleeping. <o:p>

            its first level, then, <i>Dirty Pretty Things</i> is a film about
            beaten-down, exhausted, tenaciously hopeful workers, lonely and
            dogged<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>characters who
            labor at jobs that more privileged citizens wouldn't think of doing.
            Okwe once had another life: he was a doctor in Nigeria, forced into
            exile (&quot;It is an African story,&quot; he says by way of
            explanation); now he watches the hotel desk at night, drives a cab
            during the day, and when pressed by fellow immigrants, provides
            minor medical care (say, treating his taxi dispatcher for the clap).

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Okwe
            spends his few off hours playing chess with his morgue-attendant
            friend Guo Yi (Benedict Wong), or napping fitfully on a couch in a
            flat rented by Senay (Audrey Tautou), a maid at the hotel. She has
            her own backstory, having fled an arranged Muslim marriage back in
            Turkey. Protective of her privacy (and her virginity) and
            appreciative of Okwe's gentle chivalry, she's in England on a
            temporary visa, which means she works illegally and lives in fear
            that she'll be discovered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            so, the film reveals its other levels, as it considers not only
            class disparities and the difficulties of poverty, but also the ways
            that self-interest or survival shapes actions. While director
            Stephen Frears has explored the plights of immigrants previously --
            in <i>My Beautiful Laundrette</i> (1985) and <i>Sammy and Rosie Get
            Laid</i> (1987) -- Steve Knight's script takes a particularly edgy,
            even surrealish tack, aided considerably by Chris Menges's skritchy,
            smart cinematography, darting in and out of corners, revealing bits
            of street life and indicating emotional nuance. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">All
            the urban immigrants in <i>Dirty Pretty Things</i> live
            hand-to-mouth, each day a test of patience, resilience, and, to some
            degree, moral fiber. Perhaps the most extravagant embodiment of this
            &quot;test&quot; is the hotel's day manager, Señor Juan, also known
            as Sneaky (Sergi López). Crude and unscrupulous, he's organized a
            black market in human organs (mostly kidneys), wherein he arranges
            visas, passports, and payments for people desperate to begin new
            lives elsewhere. He also sets up the surgeries, late at night in the
            hotel, often botched; when Sneaky accidentally learns that Okwe is a
            capable doctor, he tries to enlist his services, applying whatever
            underhanded pressures he can muster. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Sneaky
            -- who is distressingly smart, if cynical -- sees his own needs as
            primary as well as representative. When Okwe resists the illegal
            activities, he explains the necessary cunning of their charge as
            hotel workers: &quot;The hotel business,&quot; he says, &quot;is a
            business of strangers. Strangers always surprise you. They come to
            the hotel at night to do dirty things; it's our job in the morning
            to make it all look pretty again.&quot; Okwe surely understands this
            structure, this set of classed-raced-gendered distinctions between
            haves and have-nots, describing himself and his coworkers as
            &quot;the people you never see,&quot; those laborers who drive, wait
            on, and clean up after the folks with money. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Illuminating
            the travails of the underclass isn't news, but in <i>Dirty Pretty
            Things</i>, the focus is specific and increasingly absorbing. In
            part, this is a function of the uniformly excellent performances,
            but it also has to do with the details that define the characters,
            in particular, Okwe's quiet friendship with Guo Yi, his gentle
            efforts to protect Senay, and his complicated negotiations with
            Sneaky. While Okwe embodies a recognizable integrity, he's also
            forced to do work that he loathes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            the same time, Senay reflects a familiar, if resilient,
            victimization, providing the film with a simplified emotional
            trajectory, even amid all its complexities of moral and political
            decisions. When a couple of immigration officers get wind of Senay
            at the hotel, she seeks employment elsewhere, a sweatshop where
            she's forced to service the skeezy proprietor sexually, when he
            threatens to turn her in (&quot;I just want you to help me to
            relax,&quot; he mutters). Increasingly desperate, she dreams of the
            good life she's heard about in New York City and begins to fall in
            love with Okwe. It's easy to see how she might do either, but what's
            most compelling is the disorder and confusion of her relationship
            with Okwe, as he proves too intricate and compromised a character to
            fit into a conventional resolution. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            film's title, then, refers to many &quot;things,&quot; most
            simultaneously dirty and pretty. Not the least of these are the
            steps of daily existence, the endless cycles of scraping along to
            make rent or look after relatives. Entwined in these cycles are the
            bodies that are always at stake. Selling and buying, using and
            abusing bodies -- in parts, in sex acts, in wretched and depressing
            labor -- is the basis of capitalism. Most effectively, of course,
            bodies here are full of secrets and significance. As Juliette and
            Senay are paid for them, as Guo Yi and Okwe discuss their meanings,
            as Sneaky sells them (or pieces of them), bodies are deemed
            property, objects of trade, and perhaps, means to freedom. <o:p>
