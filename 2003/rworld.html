            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Michael
            Winterbottom's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In This World</i>
            is the second of four features (Emilio Martinez-Lazaro's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Other Side of the Bed</i>, Mark Decena's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dopamine</i>,
            and Mark Rucker's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Die Mommie
            Die</i> rounding out the specialty quartet) launched in late summer
            as the Sundance Film Series, a marketing gem promoting festival
            entries from that renown event that have heretofore not received
            commercial distribution. The features are, at least initially,
            unreeling in ten markets (including here in Washington, DC) where
            they are playing exclusively in theaters owned by the one of the
            series' co-sponsors, Loews Cineplex. In the DC-Maryland-Virginia
            metropolitan area, the films are playing in the central city venue
            and tourist attraction, Loews Georgetown, although <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In
            This World </i>has since shifted to the outlying Cineplex Odean
            Outer Circle, one of the older duplexes catering to the art house
            market. Suburban patrons are thus allowed more leisurely access
            (i.e., less downtown traffic, easier parking). Frankly, as nice as
            the Georgetown multiplex is, bordering the Potomac River, it's
            nearly impossible to visit (unless you travel by foot) without
            plugging a meter (assuming you have enough quarters and the film
            you're watching is under two hours) or being hijacked for bigger
            bucks by local parking lot owners. (My suggestion: Sunday curbside
            parking is free.)</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That the film has
            expanded beyond its confined Georgetown market is a fitting tribute
            to a work that takes a political subject (immigrant and refugee
            asylum) and paints a faux yet believable documentary veneer over the
            story of two young Afghanis attempting to smuggle themselves into
            England. The decidedly non-traditional screenplay by Tony Grisoni (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Queen of Hearts</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fear and
            Loathing in Las Vegas</i>, and the abandoned Terry Gilliam project <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Man Who Killed Don Quixote</i>) is more a opinionated roadmap for
            director Winterbottom, although certainly one that falls within the
            realm of his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">oeuvre</i>.
            Director of Photography Marcel Zyskind's bare bones digital video
            framework adds immensely to the day-in-the-life setting and the
            story's intimate urgency.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winterbottom, a
            director who has attracted a critical following for his independent
            projects over the last decade, whether it's last year's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">24
            Hour Party People</i>, a funny, madness-tinted binge into the
            yesteryear of the Manchester music scene, the little seen (and not
            very remarkable); <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Claim</i>
            (2000), an 1860s' Thomas Hardy romance set in one of those frigid,
            snow-covered, gold-seeking northern California mountain towns; the
            poignant ensemble piece <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wonderland</i>;
            or 1997's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Welcome to Sarajevo</i>,
            which deals with the Bosnian war and the orphans who are its
            victims. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">In This World</i> seems a continuation of this latter film, with its
            combination of fact and fiction, yet with his new film he succeeds
            because he has jettisoned any semblance of a professional cast and
            replaced them with two individuals with no acting experience, and
            who seem to have no inhibitions in front of the camera.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jamal Udin
            Torabi, playing the character Jamal, is a 16-year-old orphan toiling
            away in a Pakistan brick factory for the equivalent of a dollar a
            day. His older cousin Enayat (Enayatullah) is soon to be sent to
            London. What Enayat lacks (particularly the ability to speak
            English) makes Jamal the easy selection by Enayat's father to
            accompany and bakroll his relative as comrade, translator, and
            co-refugee on what will be an arduous journey across Asia and Europe
            -- a trail followed by about 1 million people each year, many
            entrusting themselves into the uncertain hands of
            &quot;professional&quot; smuggling agents.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            determined youngster with much more resolute sense than his older
            counterpart, is the person whose strong desire pushes the pair
            further along the dusty byways from his Peshawar refugee camp -- by
            bus (twice), by truck, hidden behind crates of produce, over frozen
            mountain tops, and latter in a pitch dark, sealed shipping container
            even a holocaust survivor might find more accommodating -- than he
            probably deserves to travel, considering the legal quagmire, border
            restrictions, lack of proper papers, and Enayat's gentler, and more
            susceptible, nature. Obviously the roads to freedom are not paved
            with gold, unless its stuffed away in your shoe for a rainy day.</font></p>
