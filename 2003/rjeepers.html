            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At one point in <i>Jeepers
            Creepers II</i>, a group of teenagers huddle together inside a
            broken-down bus, training a flashlight at a creature -- it looks
            human, but also looks like it's not -- peering at them, upside down,
            with great, bright eyes, from the other side of a window. It senses
            them (literally), wags a finger at them, smacks its lips, and then
            WINKS at them before -- whoosh! -- disappearing, leaving the
            teenagers -- and the audience -- to cower.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I wasn't expecting much from this
            movie – then again, I wasn't expecting much from the 2001 film to
            which this is a sequel -- but, in both instances, I was pleasantly
            surprised to find myself diverted as it went about aspiring to doing
            nothing more than entertain us with a good-and-scary story for a
            while. As in the previous film, the creature is a fast, agile,
            nefarious predator of mythical proportions that arises after
            twenty-three years of dormancy to prey upon humans for a
            twenty-three-day period. It can be slowed but not necessarily
            stopped, which doesn't bode well for the people upon whom it casts
            an eye. In the new movie, it's a high school basketball team
            returning from a championship victory when one of the tires on their
            bus blows after being hit by something that's sharp and has a human
            tooth embedded in its center. The high schoolers quickly find that
            they must fend for themselves and contend with an increasingly
            dangerous and uncertain situation while terror lets loose around
            them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Victor Salva wrote and directed
            this and the previous film, and he shows a talent for creating
            believable characters and believable situations into which
            fantastical and harrowing elements are introduced. The new film
            lacks the strong brother-sister relationship that drew us into the
            earlier film, but Salva handles the multiple characters, here, so
            that they don't turn into an undifferentiated mass. They include a
            star team player (Eric Nenninger) unhappy because he remained on the
            bench for most of the winning game, and another player (Garikayi
            Mutambirwa) who does not relish being singled-out by the creature,
            but isn't giving in without a fight, either; a school paper<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>sports reporter (Travis Schiffner) who seems to be devoting a
            lot of space to writing about one of the basketball team players in
            particular; a bus driver (Diane Delano) who doesn't mind having a
            smoke with the girls; and a cheerleader (Nicki Aycox) who gets a
            premonition of what's about to happen to them (replete with Justin
            Long reprising his character from the 2001 film).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are also the Taggarts,
            patriarch Jack (Ray Wise) and older son Jack, Jr., or Jackie (Luke
            Edwards) -- they see one of their family members carried off by the
            creature during a fairly dazzling sequence that opens the film, and
            they show up later, at a fortuitous time for the stranded high
            schoolers, fully prepared to avenge what has been wreaked upon their
            family by an evil interloper.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rather than just give us jolts to
            which we are supposed to respond (like the &quot;dancing&quot; ducks
            that respond to electroshocks in Jerzy Kozinski's novel <i>Blind
            Date</i>), the picture sits down to tell is a story about what
            happens to a bunch of characters -- the result being, like a good
            story or campfire tale, a fun experience which releases some
            cathartic chills in us before it's over. And the ending, rest
            assured, is, in the best William S. Burroughs sense, quite elegant.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
