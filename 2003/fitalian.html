<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Remaking the delightfully droll 1969 caper
film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Italian Job</i> would seem career
suicide for any filmmaker. It features an unforgettable chase involving Cooper
Minis tearing through the scenic streets of Turin, Italy and a typically
charming Michael Caine.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately, the team behind the current film
of the same title has simply kept the Minis, not the story, and the director <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">F.
Gary Gray</b>, is used to taking risks.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A former freelance cameraman, he made his mark
with short films and music videos for Whitney Houston, Coolio and TLC. The
dreamlike video he shot for TLC’s tune “Waterfalls” cleaned up at the MTV
Video Music Awards. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rolling Stone</i>
magazine named his video for Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day” as one of its
“Top 100 Best Videos of All Time.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a producer, co-writer and star, Ice Cube
helped launch Gray into features with the inner city comedy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Friday</i>, which returned $30 million on a $2 million investment.
He’s also directed the memorable female bank robber movie <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Set It Off</i> starring Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah and Vivica A.
Fox and the thriller <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Negotiator</i>
starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His last movie was the long delayed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">A Man Apart</i> with Vin Diesel, but his work on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Italian Job </i>has allowed him to stage some impressive action
sequences like a boat chase through the canals of Venice and finale where
Hollywood Boulevard is paralyzed by frantically racing Minis.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Contacted by phone from Chicago, Gray’s
recollections are intriguing because he quickly gives credit to his
collaborators and admits that even mainstream movies like the ones he makes can
be major gambles.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan
Lybarger:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> You’re an Angelino, and
I’m from Kansas City, but because of some scheduling difficulties, I’m in
Los Angeles when you’re in Chicago.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">F. Gary
Gray:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> That’s funny.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
What’s interesting about being here now is that it makes one of the jokes in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The</i>
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Italian Job</i> even funnier. There’s
the scene where Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the thieves are planning a new
heist and are wondering how long it will take in LA traffic. Then there’s a
cut to traffic standing still.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
[Laughs] Exactly. It’s very familiar to me. It’s part of the reality of the
story. I think it adds a certain level of credibility. Sometimes, it’s little
details that make it funny and more credible.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Speaking of those details, I remember when I was watching the DVD for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Negotiator</i>, in the extras you insisted on using Chicago for the
setting. Why was that?</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
It was extremely important because if we’d made <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Negotiator </i>in Los Angeles, it would have felt like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Die Hard</i>. And the cops in LA, they have more kind of militaristic
approach. They don’t even feel like real people; they feel like soldiers. In
Chicago, it’s almost like the everyday guy: your uncle, your cousin. Those are
the cops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It adds to the texture. The casting is affected
by shooting in a place like Chicago, as opposed to a place like Los Angeles.
It’s just much more interesting to tell a story like that in Chicago than it
is in Los Angeles.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
You did sort of the same with Venice in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Italian Job</i>.</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I loved shooting in Venice. You can’t point [the camera] in any direction
without grabbing a great shot. It’s a lot different in Los Angeles where you
really have to pound the pavement to find something interesting to shoot that
hasn’t been overused. Venice is the opposite. You can just throw the camera in
the air, and wherever it lands, that’s where you shoot. It makes you look
brilliant, but it’s a beautiful city.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
It must have been really tricky to stage the opening powerboat chases.</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Tricky is not the word. It was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">insanely</i>
challenging because of all the rules, restrictions and limits that accompany
shooting in Venice, which I understand because of the historical integrity of
all of the structures. And to shoot a boat chase, nonetheless, was extremely
challenging. It was tough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And on top of that to transport 400 people and
a cast in these little canals and boat taxis on a shooting schedule, we really
had to have it together. I really credit my first AD and my tie-in crew for
making that happen. We just don’t have vans and equipment trucks to help us.
We were all in little boats, and we made it happen. We shot a great chase.
Nobody really thinks about those things.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I was reading a book on the making of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lawrence
of Arabia</i>, and they had to spend all day getting footage back to base camp
for a single shot.</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Yeah. We actually had shots like that in this movie where you shut down
Hollywood and Highland. You have over a thousand extras, hundreds of cars, three
helicopters in the air, and you have to synchronize all these things—all at
once. At the same time you’re clearing out all civilians on a full city block
before you could even come close with the helicopters. To pull off a shot like
that, it takes a long time and a lot of organizing and then to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">reset</i> all the cars and all of that it is logistically out of this
world.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I’m still imagining how you would have handled those subway chases because
getting those cars through the subway, as cool as it looks, must have been a
pain.</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
It was. We used thirteen real Minis, three electric Minis—that we had to build
and create ourselves because the City of Los Angeles wouldn’t allow us to
drive Minis with combustion engines underground—, three locations, two built
sets. And the actors did their own stunts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was a logistical challenge because the set
that we built, the tunnel, was so big that it couldn’t fit in any soundstage
in southern California, so we had to rent the hangar where they built the first
Space Shuttle. And we used every single inch of it to create that sequence.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
On the human side, Seth Green’s Lyle is so much more than the token computer
hacker that’s in every other heist movie these days. Most of them are in the
background, wearing nerdy glasses…</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
And have a lot of uninteresting lines to say. That is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">all</i>
Seth. I wish I could take a lot of credit for a lot of his choices, but not only
is he a great guy; he’s a great comedic actor. He’s like the backbone of the
humor in this movie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What I love the most about him is that he’s
great at improvising. And I love to have an environment and create a level of
comfort for my actors to make contributions like that. When I give him the green
light, he creates magic. There’s the scene when he’s in the car with
Handsome Rob [played by British actor Jason Statham from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snatch</i>]
and [Green’s] mimicking him.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s
the scene I remember most.</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
He improvised that. He improvised the whole accent and everything. It wasn’t
written. It wasn’t my intention. I just said, “I have what I need, and I
need for you to give me what’s on the top of your brain.” When he did it, I
knew we had an incredible moment in the movie. As a matter of fact, so much so
that I forgot to say cut because I was laughing so hard.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
When comic actors are good at improvising like Peter Sellers was, aren’t they
often good for one or two takes?</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
With Green, you can build a movie around what he could do. And I’m not just
saying that. When you do these interviews, sometimes they feel that all he’s
going to do is say nice things about the actors. You’re not going to get
anything that’s real out of them. Trust me. Seth Green is the real deal, and
if I had something bad to say about him, I would. He was amazing. He was
amazing.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
With current filmmaking a lot of the special effects tend to be so subtle that
you have to draw attention to them. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">You’ve
Got Mail</i>, you see Meg Ryan strolling through a fall scene that was actually
shot in spring. Is there anything like that in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Italian Job</i>?</font></p>

There’s the scene in Philadelphia where they pull up to this location where
there are smokestacks that actually match Philadelphia. Great job by John
Panzarella [<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nurse Betty</i>], my location
manager. In one close up of Charlize Theron, you’ll see palm trees and realize
that you’re in California. You have to be really quick to see that.</font></p>

There’s great iconic moments in the original like the Mini Coopers and the
traffic jam and the gold heist. Those are the moments that we borrowed from the
original, and they’re great moments, and they serve our story. But it’s
definitely a different story.</font></p>

was all about the time, too, you know. That was a very stylish, fun film for the
time, and the sensibility really served the time. It really is a classic in
Great Britain. You still have the pressure because you’re using the same title
and some of the best moments. I felt the writers did a really great job at
writing a different story. It’s clever, smart. It has a lot of great twists
and turns. It’s fun, so we didn’t have to rely on just the original story.</font></p>

asked for thirty-three of them. Those cars are really fast. Really fast, faster
than I expected. So, yeah, you could get away. I truly believe that, especially
in a traffic jam, especially if you need to get through some tight spaces.</font></p>

It’s luck of the draw, you know. Whatever it is, I hope I don’t lose it.
I’ve been lucky to work with Chris Tucker and give him his first lead and
Queen Latifah and given her first lead and Bernie Mac and all the different
actors. It’s something you just feel in your heart, it’s in your heart and

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
make mainstream movies, but yet, you’ve been something of an innovator. Before
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Friday</i>, the idea of making a
“hood” comedy was unthinkable. It was considered sacrilege. You had to walk
a fine line, and with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Set It Off</i>,
you’ve got a female bank robber movie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Yeah, you’re right. Can you imagine how nervous I was, not only making a
“hood” comedy at the time? I’ll put it this way: With the type of pressure
that I had with Ice Cube’s career in my hands, now, he was the meanest guy in
rap at the time, and I’m putting him in a comedy. We just experienced him in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Boyz N the Hood</i>, a very serious drama about systematic genocide in
the neighborhoods. It was really serious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And then to put him in a hood comedy with his
reputation, it was a major gamble we all took. And it was a phenomenon that it
worked out. I wish I could say, “Yeah, we had it all planned. We knew that
when it dropped, it would start a franchise and everything that goes with the
success of it.” But to be honest with you, I was nervous. We all took a shot
with it; it stuck. And I’m happy about that</font></p>

Similarly with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Set It Off</i>, you’ve
got a female action movie, and the protagonists are more like real women than
action heroes.</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FGG: </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s
what was fun about it. That script and that movie is something that I felt a
little more confident about because I was a huge fan of Luc Besson’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">La
Femme Nikita</i>. I felt like you don’t get enough of women kicking ass and
taking numbers and having a lot of fun in a movie like that. I felt like it was
different enough, and the studio [New Line Cinema] didn’t force me to keep
them all alive at the end, which would have been the Hollywood ending. I was
really confident that that movie would stand out because of the subject matter,
the leads and the ending. I was really happy with the way that turned out.</font></p>

Why do you think that unlike other directors who’ve cut their teeth on music
videos, you’ve had some longevity? Whereas some video directors like Tim Pope
did some striking videos for The Cure and then his feature <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

music videos or short films. The key really is character and story, and if you

your music videos, I still vividly remember Coolio bouncing up and down in his
car in “Fantastic Voyage” or all the gaudy fantasy images in TLC’s tune
“Waterfalls.” Had you ever thought of doing a fantasy flick?</font></p>

That’s funny. You are so on top of it. When people ask me what I’d like to

the genres with the exception of romantic comedies. Fantasy is something that
I’d love to tackle in the near future.</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
