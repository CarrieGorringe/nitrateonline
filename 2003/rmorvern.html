			<font size="5">Still</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">
			Everything is still, except for the blinking Christmas tree lights. 
			It's relentless that light. Near the decorated tree lies a body, 
			face down. Blood from his slashed wrists spatters the floor. And 
			next to him, so close and still that at first she seems dead as we, 
			lies his girlfriend, Morvern Callar (Samantha Morton). She's 
			discovered his body this Christmas morning. And now she's unable to 
			move.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Lynne Ramsay's astonishing <i>Morvern Callar</i>, 
			which she and Liana Dognini adapted from Alan Warner's 1995 novel, 
			doesn't tell you much about Morvern's thinking. As embodied by the 
			stunning Samantha Morton, who appears to be making a career of 
			playing opaque, luminescent characters (see also: the mute 
			girlfriend in <i>Sweet and Lowdown</i>, the dead girlfriend in <i>
			Jesus' Son</i>, and the gifted, watery pre-cog in <i>Minority Report</i>), 
			Morvern is equal parts fragile and coarse. Her eyes take in 
			everything, limpid and deep, revealing a kind of rawness that's hard 
			to read. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Morvern is a puzzle the film picks at but never quite 
			solves, the focus of its probing but also respectful attention. She 
			hardly speaks, and the film observes her, without recourse to some 
			typical device, like a voiceover. You're left to your resources, 
			much as she is. Morvern cries when she's alone, for instance, in the 
			tub, her body crumpled and turned away from the hovering camera. 
			Perhaps feeling she has nowhere to go, unsure what she wants, 
			Morvern persists, game somehow, or maybe just numb. Perhaps daunted, 
			briefly, perhaps scheming a way to survive. Occasionally, she looks 
			over at the body, still lying in the doorway to the kitchen, and her 
			eyes go wide, as if wondering what she might do about it. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">That evening, Christmas night, she opens her brightly 
			wrapped presents, alone in the room with the body. She has a leather 
			jacket, a lighter, a walkman, and a mixtape assembled by her lover, 
			&quot;Music For You.&quot; Each object might say something about her dead 
			boyfriend, maybe even about her. She flicks the lighter, then puts 
			on the headphones and listens, the tracks simultaneously merging 
			with and disguising her feelings, so that they seem to translate her 
			shock, grief, and anger, but then again, maybe they don't: Can's &quot;I 
			Want More,&quot; Aphex Twin's &quot;Goon Gumpas,&quot; Boards Of Canada's 
			&quot;Everything You Do Is A Balloon.&quot; Fragmented and throbbing, the 
			music fills the soundtrack, as Morvern gives herself over to it.
			</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">She dresses up and heads to a party with her vibrant 
			friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott). When someone asks after Morvern's 
			&quot;Dostoevsky,&quot; she says only that he's home, in the kitchen, not 
			exactly a lie. They dance, get high, exchange looks with pretty 
			boys. When a couple of girls strip off their bras in the crowd, 
			Morvern looks away in embarrassment. But later that evening, when 
			she and Lanna go carousing with a couple of boys in their car, she 
			hangs out the window and turns her face to the rushing night air: 
			wordless and exultant. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Separated from the group as they continue to party in 
			the woods, Morvern stands at the side of a river, briefly caught by 
			the flashlight beam of a passing boatman: she lifts her skirt, shows 
			her panties and garters. The iris of light stays on her as the boat 
			moves on, until she drops her skirt again. This wordless exchange, 
			at a distance, sets the limit of Morvern's self-exposure&nbsp; -- a bit 
			of pale flesh, glimpsed from the perspective of someone you can 
			hardly see and will never know. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">After a night of partying, and some dull, or dulling, 
			sex, the girls walk to visit Lanna's grandmother, stooped in her 
			walker, happy to have company. She scoots the girls into a tub for a 
			good soak; here Morvern tells Lanna her boyfriend is &quot;gone&quot; and 
			never coming back, without explaining what that means. He's in 
			&quot;another country,&quot; she says, barely, as if putting ideas -- lies or 
			just abstractions -- into words will secure the finality of his act, 
			and her abandonment. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Morvern resists this sense of abandonment by staying 
			in motion. She's found a note on the computer: &quot;Sorry Morvern. Don't 
			try to understand. It just seemed like the right thing to do.&quot; 
			Whether or not she does try is hard to tell. Though he's left money 
			for his funeral, Morvern disposes of the body herself, dismembering 
			it in the bathtub as the Velvet Underground's &quot;I'm Sticking With 
			You&quot; perks along in her headphones. &quot;Cause I'm made out of glue,&quot; 
			she hears, framed in the narrow bathroom doorway, sunglasses 
			protecting her eyes from the spurting blood. It's a stunning scene, 
			but so muted and unsensational in its presentation that you're hard 
			put to know how to react. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Morvern makes another choice, to use the funeral 
			money to take Lanna on a trip to Spain. On the road, the girls leave 
			behind, for a short time anyway, their grinding jobs at a Glasgow 
			supermarket. But while the vacation -- a package including hotel 
			rooms and sunny days poolside -- delights Lanna, it leaves Morvern 
			cold. As Morvern comes to understand herself more, the girls grow 
			apart. The camera studies the natives, but like Morvern, never gets 
			close.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">In part, Morvern's ostensible development, almost 
			imperceptible, begins when she makes a surprising choice, given her 
			seeming lack of ambition -- she has, after all, worked at the 
			supermarket for some time, and her life appears stable, if dull. 
			Now, she feels suddenly rootless, or so it appears. Staring into the 
			computer screen, she puts her name on dead boyfriend's just 
			completed novel. With the Christmas lights still blinking in the 
			background, she deletes his name from the computer screen, tap by 
			tap, and puts hers on the cover page&nbsp; before she prints it out and 
			sends off to the first name on the list of publishers he's 
			assembled. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">With this strange, fateful, even aggressive decision, 
			she makes a change. Whatever her relationship was with the dead boy, 
			she now acts as if she perceives the body as an object; whether this 
			means she misses him terribly or feels abruptly loosed by its 
			appearance (and what kind of a note is that to leave someone?), the 
			film doesn't explain.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">And yet, with Morvern's appropriation of his 
			manuscript and erasure of his name, the film opens up another set of 
			questions, concerning authorship and authority, deceit and fiction, 
			longing and focus. Like Ramsay's first feature, <i>Ratcatcher</i>, 
			or even her prize-winning short films (a trilogy, included on 
			Criterion's gorgeous <i>Ratcatcher</i> DVD), <i>Morvern Callar</i> 
			defers to surfaces, allows viewers to &quot;know&quot; what and how they 
			might. Morvern's not so much an enigma as a reflection, of a set of 
			moments and desires that have as much to do with you as with her.
