Interview with Rémy Girard<br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula
Nechak</a>, 26 December&nbsp; 2003</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The face is familiar even if the name is
not. Rémy Girard, who stars as the opinionated, feisty - and fatally-ill -
academic historian in Denys Arcand’s celebrated <i>The Barbarian Invasions</i>,&quot;
has some 30 feature films and just as many television appearances on his resume.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Barbarian Invasions</i> is the sequel to
the 1986 art house hit <i>The Decline of the American Empire</i> and it took two
awards at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival - one for screenplay and the other for
Girard’s costar, actress Marie-Josee Croze (<i>Maelstrom</i>). Once tagged a
&quot;Canadian <i>Big Chill</i>&quot; the sequel catches up with a small group
of friends and academics who were once the creme-de-la-creme of university
intellect and ideals and whose private lives are messier than their public
personas could ever belie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A jovial, emotive and accessible actor who
totes an English dictionary in order to better his language skills, 53-year-old
Girard is as different as he is oddly similar to the rakish, irascible Rémy.
He’s much more doggedly devoted to his family (he’s perplexed that his cell
phone can’t ring through to his wife, who’s in France) yet his
larger-than-life personality is clearly the trait that attracted Arcand to the
actor, who is the pivotal character in both films.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paula Nechak: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
did a law student in Quebec in 1969 evolve into an actor who has won three Genie
Awards and appeared in over 30 films and just as many television shows?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Rémy Girard: </i></b>To be a law
student, well it’s like in <i>The Barbarian Invasions</i>. I wanted to make my
father pleased (laughs). He told me, &quot;You’re playing theater. It’s a
good hobby but you’ll never make your life of this.&quot; My father was a
politician and he had a dream one night and saw me being the Minister (laughs).
But things happened differently. At university, as a law student, we had a
theater troupe, Troupe des Trieze. After 2-1/2 years I said I’ll never be a
lawyer and I went to theater school. My father was really upset. But seeing I
was going to school he saw I was serious. He finally said, &quot;If you’re
serious, okay, go.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>You’ve made five films with
Denys Arcand. Do you feel indebted to him for the success of your film career?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>The success came after <i>The
Decline of the American Empire</i>. In our country we are mostly known for
television. I was known for film. <i>Decline...</i> changed my life. I was an
unknown and producers didn’t want me and they said to Arcand, &quot;Are you
sure you want this guy in the leading role?&quot; Something funny happened
because he wrote the script for me. It’s why I’m Rémy in the script. Arcand
kept our first names. I had made a small part in a film by Denys before (the
1984 film <i>Le Crime d’ Ovide Plouffe</i>). It was where we met. He had seen
me in a play in Quebec City and he said, &quot;I’m gonna make a movie, I have
a project, I’ll send you the script.&quot; I read it and thought, &quot;This
is some project!&quot; But the producers wanted me to pass an audition.
Everything begins there.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN:</i></b> How was it reconvening with
the cast from <i>The Decline of the American Empire</i> 17 years later? So much
has changed in the world, especially in the past few years, that would be of
importance to academics and historians raised with ’60s values.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>It was really magic. The
first scene we shot, I think, was the scene where Rémy arrives at the hospital.
It was the first scene we shot all together again as a group and everybody was
talking and Denys finally said, &quot;Shut up everybody and begin again.&quot;
We are a lot of people, we all know each other and we like to talk. There was no
changing.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>But the world’s changed.
Your characters have gotten older and in the face of their frailties, have lost
their innocence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>That touched me very much the
first time I saw the finished film. Baby boomers that we are, we are concerned
at change and what we will leave behind. I remember when we shot the death
scene, we were at that marvelous lake in the Eastern Township and they were
changing cameras and Pierre Curzi approached me and said, &quot;Do you think
about death Rémy? We are on the next line you know.&quot; I’m immortal, I
don’t want to die. It’s the great issue of the film I think.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>Denys Arcand is an historian
and his films irreverently present an historical perspective. He presents this
story of middle-aged academics against a backdrop of history repeating itself
and each generation believing they are the ones who make a difference.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>Denys was an historian before
he was a director and everything he talks about is concerned by an historical
point of view and what happened. I admire him for this. Some say his films are
intellectualism but I think his sense of humor says it all.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>Arcand says the person in the
film who dies has to be Rémy because he has the largest appetite for life.
Talking with you I can see that that also pertains to you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>I was surprised by it. I
never thought Denys would want to make another film after <i>Decline.... </i>Then
he said to me two years ago that he had had a flash. &quot;I’m going to take
my gang and reunite them and make Rémy die. He’s the one who loves life the
most of all of them,&quot; he said. I was really touched and I expected a better
life from this character when I thought about him during the 17 years in
between. He’s good living. But when I saw him in the <i>The Barbarian
Invasions</i> I saw him alone, apart from his wife and most important, from his
kids.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>The actors who play your
children and Marie-Josee Croze, the young junkie daughter of your character’s
friend and ex-lover Diane, are wonderful. Stephane Rousseau who plays your son,
is a comic and he also brought a ton of family baggage to the set. Croze won the
Cannes Film Festival prize for her performance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>Stephane’s father was dying
during the shoot, he died one month after. I asked him - and my own son is
6-1/2, I’m a late father, and as I did not have this issue with my own father,
our relationship was more harmonious - how it was with his father because in
truth, Stephane could be my son. He said it was very hard, &quot;We didn’t
have the relationship you have with your father.&quot; So I asked myself what is
the relationship we baby boomers have with our daughters and sons? What have we
done with our kids? I think <i>The Barbarian Invasions </i>is one of the rare
movies that talks about this thing. The sense of culpability is awful, this
notion of &quot;it’s my fault.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>So what did Marie-Josee and
Stephane bring, what different energy and new dynamic, to the set and film?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>It was very interesting.
It’s not my first movie with Marie-Josee, she played my daughter in a comedy
we made ten years ago in Florida called <i>La Florida</i>. She has this
sensibility, this huge generosity and hers was a very hard part, what with
having to do with her being a junkie and the heroin. We worked very closely to
have this kind of feeling between us. She was very wonderful. With Stephane it
was very different. Dominique Michel had said, &quot;You should see this young
man,&quot; and Denys called and said he was going to pass an audition with
Stephane Rousseau. I said, &quot;Are you crazy? He’s not an actor he’s a
comic.&quot; Denys just said, &quot;Well, we’re gonna see.&quot; We saw in his
eyes the same humor Rémy has in the first movie. Most actors who auditioned
were very serious. Stephane was serious but with the twinkle in the eye Rémy
has and we saw it was possible. Denys chose him and he was right.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>You’ve made sporadic
ventures outside the Canadian film industry - <i>Varian’s War</i> for example
- but you tend to stay within its borders. Do you have any desire for an
international career?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>Oh yes (laughs). <i>Varian’s
War</i> was made two years ago for Showtime and Barbra Streisand was a producer.
It was a co-production between three countries and I’m very happy to work with
people in other countries. I have a project in France right now. I work more
easily there because of the language, you know? I don’t think it’s possible
to have an American career but to work with Americans I should like.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>How do you define or explain
your appeal to audiences? You’ve sustained a long and very successful career
yet you aren’t typically leading man material. Is it true that character
actors maintain a greater longevity in the end? What makes audiences want to see
your work?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RG: </i></b>I really don’t know
(laughs). I think my first concern when I accepted the script to <i>The
Barbarian Invasions</i> was that it was different than before. Is it a different
role. I don’t want to be typecast, it’s like a phobia. It’s happened to me
to refuse some roles because I thought they were typecasting. That pays off I
think, because I want to bring something different even with the same character.
I don’t think I played Rémy as the same man in the first and second films.
He’s very different. It’s a challenge, a really good challenge and I think
people in Quebec, in Canada, love me for this.</font></p>
