            is an attempt at a cybernetic <i>La Ronde</i>, starting with John
            (Josh Hamilton), co-proprietor of a &quot;webcam pornographic
            website&quot; called Intercon-X, and his sex-machine roommate, Mo
            (Harold Perrineau, who seems very eager to show the audience as much
            of himself as possible), then to Moira (Isabel Gillies), a girl Mo
            has been seeing (among other things), to Ed (Eric Millegan), a
            sullen gay lad attending college in Ohio, to Al (John Fleck), whom
            Ed meets through the Intercon-X site, then to Jordan (Vanessa
            Ferlito), who watches the same peeping-tom website, Angelcam.com,
            that John does.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Probably someone, sometime, will
            make a breezy, deft movie about Internet users -- actually, the
            Belgian film <i>Thomas in Love</i> has already done something like
            that, and more -- but, before it reaches its concluding observation
            that face-to-face relationships are better than ones carried on over
            broadband, the movie doesn't begin to address the implications of
            its characters' actions or the questions they raise. In the movie,
            everyone seems glued to their home computers almost all of the time,
            and, trying to turn the Internet into a hotbed of sex, the
            filmmakers reduce everyone to the level of voyeur or exhibitionist
            -- Jordan, in fact, makes some sort of living out of waiting for
            people to contact her over the Internet so she can don a wig and
            launch into naughty-talk and touch herself while cyberspace visitors
            on the other end of wherever proceed to get-off. Everyone is looking
            for something hot, and, as soon as it appears on their P.C. screens,
            they dive right into their trousers. This may go some ways towards
            explaining the bewildering, unsolicited SPAM e-mails I keep getting
            asking if I want to enlarge my member, but the film also shows its
            characters taking everything they see and hear over the Internet as
            being the sincerest truth -- nobody raises any concerns about
            deception or being mislead, which is why, despite the considerable
            amount of exposition in the film, the characters seem fairly tiny.
            The one moment the film really comes to life is when Josh Hamilton's
            John interrupts the train-of-thought, so to speak, of Vanessa
            Ferlito's Jordan during an electronic tete-a-tete -- he demands that
            something that had been mutual abruptly be turned one-way, so that
            he can work out his own feelings and frustrations (and Jordan, being
            smart, doesn't let it affect her)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John has some excuse for sitting at
            home in front of the computer most of the time (he also records
            entries in a video diary, posted on his personal website for all to
            see) -- he's become housebound since his fiance up and dumped him.
            But why should his thoughts and his life in such a state be of
            interest to anyone else? He's a turnip sitting in front of a screen.
            The filmmakers have spent so much time creating multiple views of
            the action, multiple computer graphics, multiple screens within
            screens that they figured any distinguishing quality that wold make
            the characters and story insightful would fill itself in as things
            went along. Instead, the film streams in and out of your head, but
            it leaves a peculiar aftereffect -- the intimation that we're
            turning into a world of onanists, staring into little boxes before
            our laps and having encounters where we question not the nature of
            experience but whether or not to increase your size.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
