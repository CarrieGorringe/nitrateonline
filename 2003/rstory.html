            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>While I don't think it's good
            common practice to knock small films too harshly -- filmmaking is
            tough, from start to finish, whether you're working with one camera
            and a mike or with several million dollars -- it nonetheless must be
            said that the documentary <i>American Storytellers</i> has a number
            of things seriously wrong with it. A well-intentioned picture that
            Kevin Mukherji directed, edited, and acts as &quot;silent host&quot;
            for, it's meant to be both a homage to, and primer for, independent
            filmmaking, built on interviews with four American directors. John
            Sayles is one, yet Mukherji never mines a diverse and prolific
            filmography that ranges from <i>Return of the Secaucus 7</i> to <i>Lianna</i>,
            <i>Matewan</i>, and <i>Lone Star</i>. Harold Ramis is also included,
            even though he has never worked outside of the Hollywood studio
            system, from his first job as co-writer on <i>Animal House</i> to
            his directoral debut in <i>Caddyshack</i>. And Forest Whitaker is
            best known for his acting work than his directoral efforts, one for
            H.B.O. and two others for Hollywood studios (<i>Waiting to Exhale</i>
            was harshly criticized for its non-stop music track from start to
            finish); Whitaker mentions some of the top-flight directors he's
            worked with, but doesn't mention Clint Eastwood, who cast him to
            play Charlie Parker in <i>Bird</i> and gave Whitaker a chance to
            give one of his best performances to date. (I suspect Whitaker was
            included so that Mukherji could include an African-American
            director, in which case why not John Singleton or Kasi Lemmons,
            instead?)</b><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John McNaughton, who, along with
            Sayles, falls closest to being a bona fide independent filmmaker,
            says that he, in fact, LIKES working with the studio system rather
            than with independent companies, and offers as a cogent example the
            fate that befell a very good film that he directed, <i>Normal Life</i>,
            which was made for one company (October Films) that was then bought
            and turned into another (USA Films) whose new management decided
            that it didn't particularly like the film and dropped all support
            for it. (USA Films, in turn, was bought and turned into Focus
            Features.) The story also illustrates how <i>American Storytellers</i>
            feels like it's at least two or three years out of date -- the
            independent film boom of the 1990s officially came to an end when
            Good Machine, the production company that turned out several of
            director Ang Lee's films among others, was bought by Sony Universal
            in 2002. The Internet, which is not only changing how people look at
            movies but also the entire concept of mass entertainment as we know
            it, is scarcely mentioned at all during the documentary.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And the interviews themselves have
            a curious quality to them. McNaughton is never asked about what it
            was like to go from making his first feature, <i>Henry: Portrait of
            a Serial Killer</i>, to working with Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman,
            Bill Murray and David Caruso on <i>Mad Dog and Glory</i>; he is also
            allowed to dismiss <i>Henry</i> as something that was made simply to
            get attention, which may have been the initial impulse at the time
            but definite choices were made in how to dramatize and present the
            story which caused people to give it such positive word-of-mouth
            that it finally received a theatrical release. (And Michael Rooker,
            who played Henry, landed the second lead in Oliver Stone's film <i>J.F.K.</i>)
            McNaughton, who looks like he's about to burst into tears at any
            moment (his has been the rockiest road of the four directors seen in
            the film), also makes the utterly perplexing statement, &quot;I'd
            like to be remembered for the work, not for the external
            things.&quot; (To which you respond, such as...?)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whitaker has a tendency to lower
            his head and start speaking into the palm of his right hand, and
            says that he is influenced by &quot;primal religion&quot;, without
            elaborating why. Ramis talks on and on fatuously before finally
            arriving at some genuine point of interest (such as quoting from a
            beautiful poem that was written by a Vietnamese Buddhist monk), and
            says that he was influenced by the film <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>
            &quot;for some reason&quot;. And Sayles seems to have been
            interviewed for some other film entirely (he speaks to the camera
            while seated in a bookstore), his contributions rarely meshing with
            those made by the other three filmmakers. Sayles worked for Roger
            Corman, doing some famous script work for films such as <i>Piranha</i>
            and <i>The Howling</i> (which set the action in a northern
            California retreat where werewolves learned how to keep their
            &quot;impulses&quot; under control) before making <i>Return of the
            Secaucus 7</i>for $10,000, not a whole lot of money to make a film
            with in 1979 - 80. Sayles later went to Hollywood to film his
            much-admired but unproduced screenplay <i>Eight Men Out</i>, and the
            results turned out to be one of his least satisfying films as a
            director. (<i>City of Hope</i> and, particularly, <i>Passion Fish</i>
            got his street cred back.) Nobody, here, thinks to ask why.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
