            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            30 May 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Yes, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Finding
            Nemo</i> is another filmed-on-location animated beauty, teeming with
            incredible underwater production values, saturated with tropical
            colors, swimming with noble spirit, and awash with whimsical
            delight. Andrew Stanton, a CGI veteran on all four Pixar/Disney
            features and now first time director and co-writer, continues the
            grand, award-winning and critically acclaimed tradition that has
            made the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Toy Story</i> films, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Bug's Life</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Monsters, Inc.</i> instant comedy classics from the universe's (i.e., to
            infinity and beyond) greatest animation partnership. Every impish
            blink, every adorable dimple, every marvelously rendered drop of
            water, every shadow-encrusted fleck of plankton, every computer
            generated pixel, every heartfelt blemish, and nearly every line of
            finely-etched dialogue combine to make number five an aquatic
            treasure that will make Disney CEO Michael Eisner seriously consider
            the economic consequences should his company not quickly renegotiate
            a renewal of its distribution relationship with the incredibly
            hard-working and triumphant boys and girls of Emeryville,
            California. Coupled with its predecessors' blockbuster status, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nemo</i>
            will easily push the total world-wide ticket sales for
            Pixar-produced/Disney-released works to over $2 billion.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's obvious that the creative
            talent behind this film has found inspiration in some of Disney's
            own legendary library. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Finding
            Nemo</i> opens with a barracuda attack that leaves one cold-blooded
            creature a grieving widower and his future family of over 400 roe
            decimated save for one single egg. It's a tragic, Bambiesque moment,
            but the audience is not allowed to wallow in despair for more than a
            few seconds, although the event does delineate the lone adult
            survivor's feature-length anxiety as a single, over-protective
            parent of a rambunctious, school-age offspring. Who better to play
            the Nervous Nellie clownfish than the eternally-anxious Albert
            Brooks! His son, the eponymous Nemo, is filled with fearless
            determination, despite a stumped appendage (or &quot;lucky fin&quot;
            as his father constantly refers to it) by 9-year-old Alexander
            Gould.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a clamshell, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Finding
            Nemo</i> is the first underwater road movie. The basic set-up is
            that Nemo, while on a school field trip to the edge of his
            neighborhood, has been netted by a scuba-diving dentist. His dad,
            Marlin, chases after the butt, er boat, that will land the youngster
            in an office aquarium full of its own idiosyncratic briny prisoners
            gloriously intent on escape to fresher waters. The film cross-cuts
            between the two settings: the larger Great Barrier Reef, filled with
            glistening shark teeth, a dangling platoon of stingy pink jellyfish.
            a whale-size gulp right out of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pinocchio</i>,
            and a darkly hypnotic angler fish; and the methodical break out
            plans hatched by the glassed-in denizens.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Easily, the pearl of this
            ambitiously animated cast is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, a
            &quot;naturally&quot; blue tang fish who suffers from short term
            memory loss. Dory's every utterance, every sublimely comic
            expression raises the ocean's comedy level a few more inches. This
            ditsy, cock-eyed optimist literally collides with the self-doubting
            Marlin and the odd couple begin a yin-yang excursion for the
            pint-sized Nemo (or Elmo or whatever Dory forgetfully calls him).
            Millions upon millions of gallons of comic potential are thus mined
            as they adventure forth.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, while we ostensibly have three
            stars, the rest of the vibrant cast provides a salty froth of comic
            foam. It's not only that the voices register so well, but how they
            do so within the merry, mixed-ups caricatures that <span style="color:black">Andrew
            Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds have written into the
            &quot;roles.&quot; Let's talk a deeper look.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Barry
            Humphries (a.k.a. Dame Edna), Eric Bana, Bruce Spence are three
            sharks undergoing anger management therapy. (Four years in
            production, how coincidental that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Anger Management</i> bypassed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nemo</i>
            in hoisting the amusing flag of this fretful condition upon us.)
            &quot;Fish are friends, not food,&quot; is their mantra. (There's
            also a great in-joke here for fans who recollect the production name
            given to the title character in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jaws</i>.)
            Allison Janney (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">West Wing</i>)
            is Peach, an ebay-purchased starfish and one of the half-dozen
            guests in that Sydney aquarium. Others include Bloat (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Everybody
            Loves Raymond</i>'s Brad Garrett), a emotionally-triggered blowfish;
            Bubbles (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">King of the Hill</i>'s Stephen Root), a effervesce obsessive yellow
            tang; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Newsradio</i>'s Vicki
            Lewis is Deb, a black-and-white damsel fish caught in a reflective
            tug-of-war with herself; Gurgle (Austin Pendleton), a bacillophobic
            royal gramma; Jacques (Joe Ranft) a French cleaner shrimp; and their
            brooding leader Gill (Willem Dafoe), a Moorish Idol fish. News of
            the outside world (with Marlin's ocean mission humorously
            transmitted via a game of telephone) is provided by Nigel (Geoffrey
            Rush), a gossipy pelican who shares the tank gang's dental knowledge
            of their warden's profession, having observed the dentist and his
            patients <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">ad nauseum</i>. Even director Stanton has a memorable role as Crush, a
            current-surfing dude of a turtle.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of
            the more divinely inspired moments involves a very knowledgeable and
            impressionable school of silvery fish (collectively voiced by Pixar
            regular John Ratzenberger).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aside
            from the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jaws</i> reference,
            adult viewers with any sense of cinematic history will giggle at the
            several Hitchcockian allusions: the arrival of the dentist's vicious
            niece is cued by Bernard Herrmann's music from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pyscho</i>,
            while a distinctly visual reference borrowed from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Birds</i> plays fun with a flock of seagulls.</font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An added treat is the pre-feature
            presentation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Knick Knack</i>,
            the 1989 precursor to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Toy
            Story</i> about another water-bound escape by a snowglobe snowman.
            One final reminder: wait through ALL the end credits, as most of the
            cast has fun playing with the lengthy scroll of talent (and 43
            production babies). Watch for a special &quot;guest&quot; appearance
            by Mike Wazowski.</font></p>
