            nonchalant<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Russian
            prostitute and a wavering Orthodox Jewish rabbinical student have in
            common. Quite a bit, as shown in first-time filmmaker Eitan Gorlin's
            interesting study of two opposites colliding as unlikely sweethearts
            amid a globalized Israeli landscape and an embattled Jerusalem.
            20-year-old Mendy Weinbaum is a Yeshiva student restless that his
            studies are being affected by an increasing number of masturbatory
            urges. When he brings this disheartening morsel of information
            before his astute Talmudic scholar, he is shocked that the rabbi
            suggests the extremely unorthodox advice that he visit a harlot,
            preferably a gentile woman, to cleanse his system. Think of all the
            male Jewish neurotics out there who might have had more normal teen
            lives if their spiritual tutor offered similar advice instead of
            forcing them into angst-laden preparations for their bar mitzvahs!</b><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But as we start
            out on our visit through <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Holy Land</i>, our hero's peep into the Tel Aviv strip bar/brothel
            &quot;Mike's Place&quot; (modeled after the popular
            &quot;watering&quot; hole of the same name where Gorlin once worked
            as a bartender) instead opens up a floodgate of sexual promiscuity
            as he befriends the curly orange-red haired 19-year-old émigré
            Sasha. Her full body massage irons out more than a few sexual kinks.
            And while her impression of the primitive and stupid nature of
            Israeli men, generally, remains the same (&quot;I hope the Jews and
            Arabs kill each other until no one is left.&quot;), it doesn't
            intimidate Mendy, who takes a pedestrian job working for Mike, the
            establishment's owner, and makes an increasing number of moves on
            the object of his desire. His Talmudic studies and religious family
            in B'nai B'rak are fully tossed into the lost cause bin.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As star-crossed
            lovers the stunning Tchelet Semel and her co-star Oren Rehany hit
            all the unconventional highs that explain why Gorlin's refreshing
            debut won the Grand Jury prize at the 2002 Slamdance International
            Film Festival. She's nervous. He's bashfully shy, then secretly
            jealous at the other (paying) men in her life. Their extended family
            encompasses the hard-drinking Mike (American indie regular Saul
            Stein), a former war photographer; Razi (Albert Illuz), a Arab
            wheeler dealer entrepreneur who believes God resides in his penis;
            and &quot;The Exterminator&quot; (Arie Moskuna), a nameless American
            war zealot who has made <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">aliyah</i> to Israel and now is perfectly at home with the M-16 rifle
            cradled in his arms. He sleeps with it under his pillow. Among the
            group, there are ulterior political motives adrift that most viewers
            won't realize are hiding behind the increasingly romantic
            smokescreen of young love. The film's alarming end brings this
            message out full force.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rehany cuts Mendy
            from nice sad sack mold. He's uncomfortably anxious to turn Sasha's
            many admirers away from his pretty woman. His gullibility is
            endearing. It's also his downfall, particularly when Mike and Razi
            maneuver him to help them smuggle a package into Jerusalem while the
            group is off in a nomadic wasteland off the road to Hebron. Mendy
            stumbles about as he tries to grab hold of his new lifestyle and
            cast off his old clothes. Yet it's not until after a few powerful
            tokes on a hash pipe that his body goes limp and Sasha breaks the
            last discernable link to his nearly abandoned past, cutting off his
            long sidelocks of hair, reluctantly forcing him out of the
            hedonist's closet in which he has been hiding from his parents and
            fellow students. Watching over his shoulder and a ton of guilt.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
