            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            25 April 2003</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The men 
			and women who mocked small town theatrics and professional dog shows 
			are again at play in the wacky world of Christopher Guest, a 
			director, actor, and writer (with fellow nut case Eugene Levy) who 
			has now &quot;documented&quot; the legacy of 60s folk music as gathered 
			together for a grand present-day memorial concert. While his latest 
			directorial effort is weaker (yet warmer) than his earlier 
			excursions into improvisational satires (<i>Waiting for Guffman</i> 
			and <i>Best in Show</i>), the cast is just as willing to dress up 
			their eccentric characters with the outlandish idiosyncrasies that 
			still make <i>A Mighty Wind</i> one of the more enjoyable comedies 
			this year.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You may be surprised to learn that 
			the glint for this new ensemble piece heralds all the way back to a 
			November 3, 1984 skit on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> when Guest and 
			Harry Shearer were cast members and Michael McKean hosted. On that 
			date The Folksmen (who some ridulously compare to the more 
			non-fictional group The Kingsmen) made their network debut. The trio 
			reunited recently, in character, as the end wrap musical performers 
			on <i>Late Night with David Letterman</i>. Aside from their 
			participation in the soundtrack album, I hope some of their 
			out-of-print titles, <i>Hitchin'</i>, <i>Singin'</i>, and <i>Pickin'</i>, 
			receive a much-deserve resurrection next to the precious few 33's (<i>Ramblin'</i>,
			<i>Wishin'</i>) in my vinyl collection, where they can share space 
			next to my dust-covered turntable, which has been spinning 
			continuously since 1969, except during power outages. Of course, I 
			have never played any of The Folksmen platters. It's not that I 
			don't like their music, the discs just have no spindle holes. While 
			the band originated at nearly the same time as the rock group Spinal 
			Tap (chronicled in the groundbreaking feature <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i> 
			from director Rob Reiner), to which all three Folksmen bear an 
			astonishing physical resemblance and share the same manic 
			irreverence and deadpan delivery, both groups operate in distinctly 
			different musical spheres.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That was then, this is now. And 
			with two other musical sensations from the Sixties—Mitch &amp; Mickey 
			(Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as two-thirds of Peter, Paul &amp; 
			Mary) and The New Main Street Singers (a largely reconstructed 
			entity akin to The New Christy Minstrels and Up With People, 
			highlighted by Parker Posey, John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch, and 
			Paul Dooley)—they all take center stage in <i>A Mighty Wind</i>, 
			gathering in tribute to the late Irving Steinbloom, a legendary 
			impresario and father to a nearly imbecilic son (Bob Balaban) who 
			convenes the musicians, their management, their publicists, and a 
			television network for one night of blessedly zany shenanigans.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If getting there is half the fun, 
			then the back story that Guest and Levy construct with their help of 
			their thespian family mimics the similar unraveling storyline in <i>
			Best in Show</i>, although the current absurdist road trip features 
			amusing filler more akin to that revealed in <i>This is Spinal Tap</i>, 
			including decades-old album covers and television appearances (and 
			thankfully no spontaneously combustible drummers). The cast's past 
			lives are filled with expectantly droll tales and weird accents, and 
			the now-trademark pokerfaced performances. There's even an ex-porno 
			queen, Laurie Bohner (Lynch). Yet, naturally, they all sing (most of 
			them fairly well).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The improvised comic situations 
			colonize the film, the folk music's lost, forgotten, or otherwise 
			engaged icons as popularized generations ago by the late Mr. 
			Steinbloom, reconnect over a two week span. The reclusive, 
			foggyminded, wide-eyed Mitch Cohen removes his straitjacket at the 
			Cherry Hill Psychiatric Hospital to seek out partner Mickey, a 
			single act married to a man in the bladder management industry. 
			Levy's expressions remain relatively constant, somewhere between a 
			lost soul caught between constipation and diarrhea. O'Hara's the 
			film's humorous earth mother. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Folksmen are the film's 
			passionate core, even if one of them (Shearer) looks like a cross 
			between a lumberjack, a leprechaun, and one of Santa's elfish 
			helpers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Probably the most fascinating 
			characters is bleach-blonde, spiked-haired (early DC voltage, I 
			believe) Mike LaFontaine (Fred Willard), the personal manager of The 
			New Main Street Singers, a Florida-based feel-good group. Willard, 
			as he did in <i>Best of Show</i>, steals the show with and endless 
			array of silly catch phrases. Ah to be a fly on the wall in this 
			man's brain! As for members of his troupe, they're often occupied 
			worshipping the cultish power of color.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ed Begley does a passable shtick as 
			Lars Olfen, a public broadcasting network looking for a TV tie-in 
			with his geriatric ally-aligned audience. Despite his Scandinavian 
			background he is often heard spouting Yiddish phrases.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Halfway through the film, the 
			talent arrives in New York and the publicity machine under the 
			guidance of Wally Fenton (Larry Miller) and Amber Cole (Jennifer 
			Coolidge) unleash their professional best, albeit Amber's echo-laden 
			accent is one of the strangest I have ever heard -- a combination of 
			several European nations, Martian, and a deaf woman. For such a big 
			woman, she's got a pea-sized brain, marveling about how model trains 
			inspired the invention of their big brothers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The concert continues the send-up, 
			with the typically six-month-later follow-up putting the parties 
			back in their expected places. <i>A Mighty Wind</i> keeps the comedy 
			in tune. Even the flat humor comes off witty and sharp.</font></td>
