            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Tim Burton's latest flight into
            fantasy lands a near-solid hook, line, and sinker as a whimsical
            family fable<span style="color:black"> which should enchant those
            audiences dedicated enough to drag their kids after they've spent a
            small fortune on tickets, popcorn, soft drinks, and over three hours
            of their holiday time at that other fantasy. You know, the
            brilliantly entertaining trilogy-ending spectacle alighting this
            Christmas at megaplexes from here to the moon (where the box office
            grosses are out of this world). But that kingly return of a movie is
            but one in a seasonal sea that has plenty of room for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big
            Fish</i>. If the battle-weary kids (or you) want something lighter
            than Frodo, Sam, Gollum, a digital cast of tens of thousands, and
            that dreaded ring, take a side trip around Mount Doom and think
            about sinking a hook into this sweet, personal offering.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Finding Nemo</i>, that other big aquatic animal movie this year,
            Burton's film starts out underwater, with a huge, larger-than-life
            catfish in a pond in Ashton, Alabama. The critter is thematically
            introduced as the mystical centerpiece to the Southern fried tall
            tales that have been told and retold for decades by traveling
            salesman and irrepressible optimist Edward Bloom (Albert Finney).
            Those delightful stories, heard too often by his son Will (Billy
            Crudup) for the child now turned man to stand or believe them, thus
            estranging the skeptical offspring from his now terminally ill
            father. Also, dad's absence on the homefront as he was roaming his
            presumed make believe world took its toll on a firmly planted son
            who could only dream of a normal family life. Persuaded by his
            mother Sandra (Jessica Lange), the prodigal son reluctantly returns
            home with his pregnant French wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to
            attempt reconciliation. Instead he finds the same old curious yarns
            that have haunted him being relived by Edward the younger (Ewan
            McGregor). &quot;He's never told me a single true thing,&quot; Bill
            complains about his father.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
            an endearing charm to the way Finney and his drawl spread out his
            life's over-sized story, and how Burton boldly and brightly fleshes
            out Daniel Wallace's book <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Big Fish, a Novel of Mythic Proportions</i>, as adapted by John August (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Go</i>,
            co-writer on both <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Charlie's
            Angels</i> films). Like the eternal smile on McGregor's face as he
            bounds about the Alabama countryside and beyond, there is certain to
            be a least a smidgeon of a grin on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>most viewers' faces as the film ambles through its two-hour
            length. For Burton, who stumbled badly with the 2001 remake of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Planet
            of the Apes</i>, he's back in good whimsical form. His new outing is
            closest in fanciful tone to his marvelously visionary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Edward
            Scissorhands</i> (which share more than a handful of the same
            technical crew with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big Fish</i>,
            including composer Danny Elfman), while the storytelling style is
            more akin to that used in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Forrest
            Gump</i>. Ultimately I'd grade it somewhere just below <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Scissorhands</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beetlejuice</i>.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film's allure is in Burton's signpost production design and the
            eccentric characters that populate the imaginative story. The sets
            flourish with amusing eye appeal, particularly 18-year-old Edward's
            &quot;early arrival&quot; in the obscure town of Spectre, just off
            the map and down the road from Stepford. Here he meets the
            barefooted inhabitants who have tossed their shoes out of harm's
            way, dance on perfectly manicured lawns, and dine on apple pie. They
            share a deadly secret that they might not know themselves. Among the
            many strange people Edward meets along the mythical highway are a
            one-eyed witch (Helena Bonham Carter); a hungry, towering giant
            (Matthew McGrory); Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), an amateur
            poet-crook turned stockbroker; a diminutive ringmaster (Danny
            DeVito); and conjoined twins (Ada and Arlene Tai). There's more than
            a few illustrious set pieces, including the time-stopping moment
            when Edward meets Sandra Tippleton, his future wife (</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alison
            Lohman<span style="color:black">); a Korean War variation (from the
            enemy's side) of a USO tour featuring a bad Edgar Bergen-Charlie
            McCarthy act; and a comic sequence showcasing Bill's birth.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually
            the film transforms a father's far-fetched memories of foolishness
            into a haunting, somberly comic search for a deeper truth. A truth
            that reunites a family, allowing an immature child to see the forest
            through the trees. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big Fish </i>offers
            a harmless (other than some brief nudity and mild profanity)
            excursion into a world populated not by big-budget battle scenes,
            but by strange and insightful creations, be they large, conjoined,
            or other sideshow attractions. If you have a chance, trade in a few
            hobbits for a film with magical powers that will hook you along for
            a wondrous ride.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
