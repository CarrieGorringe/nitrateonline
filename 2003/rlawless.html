            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			Nicholas Schager, 7 March 2003</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The word “courage” is bandied about in 
			Neil Hunter and Tom Hunsinger’s <i>Lawless Heart</i>, a British 
			drama that follows the intersecting lives of three men brought 
			together by the death of a loved one. And like its characters – a 
			trio who dare to seek happiness, comfort, and relief despite the 
			external and internal pressures that weigh upon them – this rather 
			touching film displays its own modest courage in unflinchingly 
			depicting the just-concealed similarities that bind us together and 
			the impenetrable barriers that keep us apart. A modest but 
			nonetheless engaging study of wounded friends trying to pick up the 
			pieces of their fractured lives, it’s a small triumph that sidesteps 
			sentimentality for a rough, authentic passion for life’s amusing and 
			poignant twists of fate</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The funeral of a gay restaurateur 
			named Stuart occasions the reunion of three disparate men and 
			provides the starting-off point for each of the film’s three 
			semi-related stories; like the recent French import <i>He Loves Me, 
			He Loves Me Not</i>, the film is structured so that the same 
			narrative time frame is shown from each character’s unique point of 
			view. The film begins with Stuart’s brother-in-law Dan (Bill Nighy), 
			a fifty-ish husband and father of three who leads a quiet, 
			economically-challenged life tending his farm. Dan is emotionally 
			comatose, telling an attendee at the funeral that he doesn’t know if 
			he’s depressed or not because he “doesn’t know the meaning of the 
			word.” Although incapable of recognizing it, Dan is the walking 
			dead, and he embraces his safe, tranquil existence with wife and 
			brood like a man stranded at sea clings to his life preserver.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan objects to his wife Judy’s 
			(Ellie Haddington) desire to bequeath Stuart’s monetary assets to 
			Nick (Tom Hollander), Stuart’s mousy longtime companion who, even 
			after his boyfriend’s death, continues to exist (literally and 
			figuratively) among the tattered ruins of their lost relationship. 
			At the funeral, Nick takes on a roommate –&nbsp; Stuart’s cousin Tim 
			(Douglas Henshall), who has just returned home after eight years 
			traveling abroad – but it’s the appearance of a wild woman named 
			Charlie (Sukie Smith) who ignites strange and frightening feelings 
			in Nick’s heart, much to the chagrin of Judy. Meanwhile, as Nick’s 
			budding romance with Charlie forces him to reevaluate both his 
			sexuality and his loyalty to Stuart’s memory, Tim – a carefree 
			hippie without a responsible bone in his body – returns to find his 
			parents uninterested in his presence and a hometown just as sleepy 
			and dull as he remembered. He strikes up a romance with Leah 
			(Josephine Butler), a local clothing store owner, but when it’s 
			revealed that his new paramour has unfinished business with his 
			childhood friend David (Stuart Laing), Tim learns that love isn’t 
			quite as simple and carefree as he’d like.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As its title suggests, <i>Lawless 
			Heart</i>’s three plots all elucidate how the longings of the human 
			heart can be neither predicted nor controlled, but writers/directors 
			Hunter and Hunsinger wisely layer their thematic objectives just 
			under the action’s surface. Although each man realizes how Stuart’s 
			death has, in one way or another, forced them to confront things 
			they’d just as soon continue to ignore – Dan’s craving for romantic 
			stimulation; Nick’s fear of facing the unknown future alone; Tim’s 
			stunted maturity – the film never succumbs to preachy moralizing. 
			What’s most impressive about <i>Lawless Heart</i> is that it 
			presents its characters’ sometimes-dubious actions as the natural, 
			desperate behavior of people groping for answers. These intertwined 
			dramas are set amidst a marshy stretch of cold, windswept, barren 
			British countryside, and the harsh physical landscape is a subtle 
			reflection of the difficult emotional choices each must face.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Early on, Dan tells Nick that 
			adultery is simply a matter of <b><i>carpe diem</i></b>, and the 
			comment is a somber articulation of regret for not chasing down the 
			life he wanted. Yet Hunter and Hunsinger aren’t interested in 
			casting a depressing pall, and the ensuing scene – which finds Dan 
			getting a variation of what he wished for, only to realize that it 
			wasn’t quite what he had envisioned – is indicative of this engaging 
			film’s tender, playful spirit. The filmmakers have a knack for 
			seamlessly blending casual comedy into their tragic framework, and 
			it’s to their credit that the off-hand blending of elation and 
			sorrow feels unforced.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If only the duo had stopped ten 
			minutes earlier and avoided the uplifting finale, which finds Dan, 
			Nick, and Tim reunited and strengthened by the events of these 
			momentous post-funeral days. Still, if the film ends on a somewhat 
			maudlin and contrived note, its finely drawn characters and 
			unassumingly graceful storytelling ultimately makes its somewhat 
			sappy climactic misstep easy to forgive.</font></td>
