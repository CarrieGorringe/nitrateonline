            the website promoting <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> and you'll only
            begin to get a sense of the film's familiar strangeness. The page
            opens as a photo album, amateur snapshots of a family arranged on
            each page, tagged with mundane titles: &quot;The Boys,&quot;
            &quot;Arnie,&quot; &quot;The House,&quot; &quot;Jessie.&quot; The
            pictures themselves document facades, the sort that everyone
            conjures for family photo collections. &quot;Me and Arnie,&quot;
            Elaine Friedman appears to have written under one of the couple,
            young, relaxed, nearly nuzzling in front of their Great Neck, Long
            Island home. A shot of a pleasant-faced kid with big glasses and
            sticks in hand is labeled, &quot;David on the drums, a musician just
            like his father!&quot; Another shot, showing two kids with moppy
            dark hair and eyes squinting in the sun, is marked &quot;Jesse grabs
            a piggy-back from big brother David.&quot; And still another, an
            interior is titled, &quot;Arnie's office/inner sanctum -- don't
            touch!&quot;<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            this last that hints at the roiling chaos beneath all these happy
            faces and still surfaces. <i>Capturing the Friedmans</i> is, as its
            own title suggests, is about capturing this family, in various ways
            -- most obviously, in photos, on 8mm film and video. For, as it
            turns out, the Friedmans themselves were ruthless self-documenters,
            for which director Andrew Jarecki must be mightily grateful even as
            he might be appalled. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie is also about capturing them in bad acts, or rather, bad
            intentions, or maybe just out of place. It is about the cops coming
            after dad Arnold, an award-winning high school teacher, and his
            youngest son Jesse (18 at the time of his arrest, the day before
            Thanksgiving, 1987). They were accused of sexually and physically
            abusing their young students, during computer classes Arnold taught
            in their suburban basement at 17 Picadilly Road. And it is also
            about the hysteria that captured their community, the cops, the DA's
            office, the media, even the Friedmans themselves. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            they vowed at first to fight their accusers, father and son ended up
            pleading guilty, hoping to earn lesser sentences than they risked
            with trials. In fact, they lost everything. Arnold died in prison in
            1995, and Jesse was released in 2001, after serving 13 years of a
            16-year sentence. In trying to come to a sense of what happened,
            Jarecki interviews Elaine and David, Arnold's brother Howie, some
            police investigators (one describes the precise wrong way to
            question a child, essentially implanting ideas into her mind,
            announcing proudly that this was the procedure the department
            followed when going house to house during their inquiry) and a judge
            (brother Seth declined to be interviewed for the film). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jarecki
            also speaks to several of Arnold's ex-students, who either can't
            imagine that such events occurred (hair-pulling, raping,
            peanut-butter-smearing, in the classroom in front of other students,
            and all without a single bit of physical evidence, ever, over the
            years the abuse was supposedly taking place) or one who is filmed in
            identity-protecting shadow, and can't be sure, because he was
            hypnotized when he came up with his &quot;memories.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            other words, the film, for all its lack of professed judgment of its
            subjects, makes a clear case that Arnold and Jesse were victims --
            of neighbors and news media and a judicial system (see also: the
            McMartin trial, made into an HBO fiction film starring James Woods).
            To frame this argument, Jarecki talks with journalist Debbie Nathan,
            who has previously reported on such cases and was contacted by the
            Friedmans in 1989, just after they were incarcerated (see her recent
            summary of the case in the <i><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0321/nathan.php" target="_top">Village
            Voice</a></i>. She supports the film's contention that the case was
            bogus, a function of its historical moment and a tragedy for the
            family. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            grueling as the story is on its own, the film underlines all the
            injustice and hypocrisy heaped on the family with frankly
            unnecessary manipulations, snapshots of the family on the beach or
            in the backyard, transition shots with sentimental music, sprinklers
            and trees to set off the unsoiled surfaces that hide secrets and
            calamities (if the Friedmans are hiding such secrets, such images
            suggest, what else is going on in the burbs?).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet,
            for all the poignancy such shots Jarecki's access to photos and
            exteriors is nothing compared to the other goldmine he stumbled on.
            The founder of MovieFone, he sold the company and set out to make a
            film, in particular, about children's party clowns. With this
            project in mind, he began to interview Silly Billy, that is, David
            Friedman, a popular party clown in New York City. Impressed by the
            young man's seeming candor as much as his often visible anger,
            Jarecki proceeded to ask questions that took them beyond the clown
            business, and soon learned the disquieting backstory. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            incredibly, David granted access to hours and hours of his own home
            movies -- he filmed and taped his family throughout the arrest and
            trial period to document his family's implosion and then granted
            Jarecki free use of the footage. This is the most devastating aspect
            of the film, not David's strenuous defense of his father,
            condemnation of Elaine (he blames her for convincing Arnold and
            Jesse to plead rather than stand trial), or even his own sense of
            guilt, clearly ravaging him -- not for having done anything wrong,
            but for having survived the ordeal. His video
            &quot;confessionals&quot; are harrowing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And,
            it turns out that Arnold carried his own burden for years before the
            arrest -- a pedophile with a stash of magazines discovered by cops
            with a search warrant in 1987. He recalls that, following his own
            molestation, when he was 13, he abused his 8-year-old brother,
            Howard. That Howard has no similar recollection surely complicates
            the confession (and brings poor Howard, interviewed as an adult,
            nearly to tears). It also lays out the film's most sustained, least
            answerable question. What is the truth? And how would you know it if
            you saw it? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">David's
            home videos appear at first look to offer some sort of truth, if
            only because they present raw, difficult pain. More acutely and more
            completely than could any interview or assembled research, these
            scenes -- the Friedmans arguing in the kitchen, over Seder dinner,
            in the basement -- render the devastating toll that this revelation
            took on them, individually and as an increasingly decrepit unit. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            sorts of questions emerge in the wake of these sequences, not least
            being: why would anyone expose this raw pain to the light of day,
            much less the voracious public -- consuming everything from <i>Fear
            Factor</i> to jennicam.com, from <i>Anna Nicole Smith</i> to <i>Wildest
            Police Chases</i>. That's not to say that a documentary film making
            the festival and art house circuit (and winner of the documentary
            Grand Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival) will attract
            precisely the viewers as <i>Punk'd</i>, but it appeals to the
            prevailing collective desire, however disparaged by watchdoggy
            pundits or professional critics. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            isn't to say that such desire is wrong or right or has any
            conventional moral valence, only that it is produced and cultivated,
            constructed and consumed. David's stated intention in revealing his
            family's horrific story is to exonerate his father and brother
            (whether or not he means to indict his mother, he surely does), and
            the film's effect is to challenge the investigative and official
            processes. Much like the promotional website, the film is all about
            pictures that seem simultaneously candid and posed, nostalgic and
            harsh. Above all, they seem: there's no telling what anyone was
            thinking or feeling at any point, for sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            provocatively, in doing all of these things, <i>Capturing the
            Friedmans</i> also undermines its own ostensible project, to find a
            truth, to get at a story that makes sense, that explains what
            happened. And so, the project becomes much more complicated, dense,
            and endless. The film bravely turns in on itself, resolving nothing
            and capturing less. <o:p>
