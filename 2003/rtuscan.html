            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula
            Nechak</a>, 26 September 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have no doubt that <i>Under the
            Tuscan Sun</i> will not fail to appeal to and slavishly please a
            certain faction of audience: those who believe these kinds of things
            will actually happen to an average Joe or Jane and that
            opportunities such as this can arise for most of us who live on a
            middle-class income and with kids and cars and school fees. The film
            is a fairy tale for the privileged: flagrantly gorgeous to look at,
            easily earnest in its sincerety and it carries the weight of a
            hummingbird’s fluttering wing in its message to not ever quit
            trying and believing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i> is
            based upon one of those obscenely popular escapist books that deal
            with Americans falling in love with, say, Provence (<i>A Year in
            Provence</i>) or in this case, Tuscany. Based upon Frances Mayes’
            bestselling book, director and writer Audrey Wells (<i>The Truth
            About Cats and Dogs</i>, <i>Guinevere</i>) nevertheless concedes her
            script is a &quot;loose&quot; adaptation of its source text.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The actor Diane Lane, who is
            certainly accomplished and graced with an intelligent sexiness is
            under a great deal of scrutiny and pressure to carry her first film
            since splashing back from maudlin roles last year as an
            upper-middle-class wife swept away in a doomed and adulterous affair
            in Adrian Lyne’s <i>Unfaithful</i>. That was a role that
            bequeathed this very fine and smart performer with a best actress
            Oscar nomination - which she rightfully deserved for her nuanced,
            complex performance. But Lane is more complicated than Wells’
            shallow adaptation, one which gives her little to do but reflect in
            voice over or wistfully succumb to the lame cliches of the script,
            and she comes across somewhat over the top because of the callow
            material.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lane plays Mayes, a writer from San
            Francisco who discovers her husband is cheating on her. Soon
            divorced and disenfranchised, Frances takes up residence in a
            furnished apartment for newly-liberated singles. Her friend, a very
            pregnant Patti (Sandra Oh) presents her with a ticket for Italy -
            and after much rumination and the realization that she could
            ostensibly be stuck in this sad hell forever, Frances grabs the
            opportunity. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
            obvious occurs: she meets a mysterious and glamorous omen (Lindsay
            Duncan) straight out of a Fellini film, who encourages her to buy
            Bramasole, which translates to &quot;something that yearns for the
            sun,&quot; a run down villa that is 300 years old. Frances takes a
            gamble, tossing caution, to the four winds.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You’ve bought a house for a
            life you don’t even have,&quot; she ruminates later, sodden with
            buyer’s remorse. But no matter, the Tuscan gods are good: in short
            order she is having the run-down villa restored by the most decent
            and honest crew of workers imaginable, meets a handsome antiques
            dealer and plays hostess to the town’s misfits and regulars.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is an undercurrent of
            condescention in the elementary easy gratification of <i>Under the
            Tuscan Sun</i>. It seduces with its beauty and spoon fed dose of
            possibility but underneath lies something less than liberated dreams
            come true. The film is too &quot;too:&quot; too beautiful, too
            calculated, too eager and ultimately too simplistic. It’s got less
            gristle than a Lifetime movie and it rankles just a bit because it
            purports to be one woman’s clutch at a new life when it seems
            she’s merely looking for a duplicate of the old one in an exotic
            new venue.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
