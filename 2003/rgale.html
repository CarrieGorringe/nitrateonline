            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>The Life of David Gale</i>,
            Kate Winslet plays a reporter for an American news magazine who is
            sent down to a prison in Texas to interview the title character
            (played by Kevin Spacey), a philosophy professor and outspoken
            opponent of the death penalty who has landed on death row himself
            after being convicted of committing a rape and murder. Did he really
            do it? Has been set up by his enemies, political or otherwise? The
            reporter has three days to talk to Gale before his scheduled
            execution, which shows no signs of being delayed, and to get at the
            truth.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alan Parker has directed the
            picture, from an original screenplay by Charles Randolph, and, as in
            <i>Mississippi Burning</i>, he is in his crusading mode, here. Or so
            it would appear. Winslet's character is named Bitsey Bloom, works
            for a glossy magazine named &quot;NEWS&quot;, and is described
            (jocularly, one would hope) as &quot;Mike Wallace with P.M.S.&quot;;
            she got into trouble over<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>her
            last story, on child pornography, because she wouldn't reveal all
            her sources. Accompanied to Texas by a young intern (Gabriel Mann)
            who serves as both her flunky and as comic relief, they enter a land
            of bar-b-q joints, no cell-phone service, coiled barbed wire, and
            big menacing men with guns. During Gale's interview sessions, we
            see, as the camera spirals outward, his recent history unfold in
            flashback: this includes Gale having consensual sex with a female
            student (&quot;Bite me!&quot; she instructs) who then turns around
            and yells &quot;rape&quot; on him; the dissolution of his marriage,
            his career, his advocacy, and winding up as an alcoholic in a motel
            that's such a dive it has mud instead of water in its swimming pool;
            Gale's relationship with a another anti-death penalty advocate,
            played by Laura Linney; and a videotape which provides clues that
            indicate that the murder for which Gale was tried really was a
            set-up. (Bitsy and the intern even go so far as to, dangerously,
            re-enact the murder, to show that some things which should have
            occurred while it was being committed did not.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While I will try to avoid letting
            slip the two big surprise twists which figure prominently in the
            movie (as Hitchcock or William Castle would say, they're the only
            ones it's got), I will state that two of the characters are shown
            acting in such a way that repudiates, to an outrageously grotesque
            degree, everything that they've spoken about, stood for, and
            professed to believe in, and that a third character becomes the
            victim of a mind game whose results can only be described as being
            frankly sadistic. <i>Life of David Gale </i>turns out to be all
            about manipulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            death-penalty opponents in the film want to show that
            &quot;innocents&quot;, in spite of what the Texas politicians in the
            movie are shown saying, really do go to the death chamber. The film
            doesn't go about trying to prove its point by presenting an argument
            and providing evidence and proof to support its claim -- if it did,
            it could've easily drawn upon matters of public record which
            document many, many actual cases where people were executed, or
            narrowly avoided it, for crimes they did not commit. Instead, the
            movie handles everything as if it were all one-upmanship. The only
            way the death penalty &quot;abolitionists&quot; can win is by doing
            something so outrageous that it would render their opposition
            powerless, even if it ends up turning themselves into extreme
            hypocrites.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film opens with Winslet making
            an Arthur Chipping-like sprint down a road, as if she were trying to
            get away from someone or trying to get somewhere on short notice;
            two hours later, we find out why. This would mean something if the
            picture presented us with characters who actually engaged us, but it
            does not: Winslet and Spacey deliver almost neutral performances
            (Spacey has NEVER been the same ever since he won the Oscar for <i>American
            Beauty</i>), and Linney only manages to do slightly better in
            bringing some shading and dimension to her role. Which is probably
            why, after starting out as if it were sincere in its intent, showing
            the characters bucketing-out on their convictions, with no grief or
            conscience, seems twice as offensive, especially after the second
            surprise plot twist is delivered to us, right between the eyes,
            right before the closing credits roll, and we are only allowed to
            respond either one way or the other.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are ways of doing this which
            have a lot more integrity. A film such as <i>Dead Man Walking</i>
            managed to combine both the ugly and the humane in such a way that
            it genuinely engaged you in a consideration about the issues
            surrounding capital punishment and the putting of criminals to
            death, as well as going further in causing you to address your own
            feelings regarding beliefs, ethical and otherwise, that may be
            connected to it. (For one thing, the picture turned out to be one of
            the most intensely spiritual films I'd ever seen.) But, since <i>The
            Life of David Gale</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>doesn't
            give us three-dimensional characters and it keeps tipping its hand
            to us outrageously throughout (crucifix imagery and references
            abound, one can clearly make out the Leonard Cohen song that opens
            and closes <i>Natural Born Killers</i> during a party scene, and one
            of Gale's last words to Bitsy is, &quot;Maybe death is a
            gift....&quot;), we can only turn our cold gaze upon the movie
            itself -- just as its cold gaze turns on Winslet's character in the
            end but also does so in a way by which it can stare at us, watching,
            in the audience, as if it, fatuously and vainly, were expecting us
            to be there -- and say that it reduces whatever it has to say about
            serious issues into speciousness and trickery. You feel like giving
            it a good swat, in the end, but, depending on your reaction, a swat
            may be letting it off too lightly. Because the movie cops out by
            telling us that everybody, but everybody, is a sell out. That's
            either lazy, or something that you simply refuse to accept.</font></td>
