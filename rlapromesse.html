<p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="4">n the economically ravaged
industrial town of Seraing, on the banks of the Meuse river in French-speaking southern
Belgium, a sordid story of illegal immigration, filial allegiance and moral bankruptcy
yields a redemption of sorts in <i>La Promesse</i> (The Promise), a disarmingly raw but
meticulously constructed new film from brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne. A logical
choice for moviegoers looking for intellectual nourishment among the blockbuster bonbons
on offer from the Hollywood thrill factory this summer, the film is at once a tutorial on
certain social dilemmas facing the new Europe and the engrossing emotional odyssey of a
young boy who must summon the strength to make a right choice in a world where life has
gone very wrong.</font></p>

<p>Fifteen-year-old Igor (Jérémie Renier) is first seen lifting a woman's wallet as he
works on her car. While struggling to learn the mechanics trade, the good-looking but
haunted teenager spends most of his time assisting his father Roger (Olivier Gourmet), an
overweight, myopic, single-minded hustler who runs a squalid, government-sanctioned
boarding house for illegal immigrants. Seemingly a veteran of every opportunity for graft
and corruption his station offers, Igor is stunned when his father insists on covering up
the accidental death of illegal African laborer Amidu Badolo (Rasmané Ouédraogo) -- who,
before being entombed in the cement foundation of the house he'd been working on, exacted
a promise from Igor to care for his wife (Assita Ouédraogo, no relation) and infant son.</p>

<p>From this moment on Igor is pulled in two directions, as the coarse, amoral but
relatively stable life with father conflicts directly with his growing awareness that what
they did was wrong. In the end, Igor fulfills his promise to Amidu after a fashion, but
not without a seismic change in his own life that represents a step in the right direction
but is no assurance of a bright future. </p>

<p>The Dardennes were born and raised in Seraing, and have made socially conscious Leftist
documentaries on labor issues and films about Nazi resistance in Belgium from their base
there since 1975. Their third feature (and first to get an American distributor), <i>La
Promesse</i> displays not only their mastery of a verite style but their individual
training as well; Jean-Pierre worked as a stand-up comedian and in experimental theater,
while Luc took a degree in philosophy. A logical and successful blend of those disciplines
in the service of dramatic social criticism, the film -- inspired by an exchange between
Marcel and his mother in Dostoyevski's &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;
(&quot;...everyone is guilty in everyone's eyes...&quot;) was planned with an exhaustive
attention to detail that blended a verite style with meticulous preparation typified by
the filmmakers' insistence that newcomer Renier and stage actor Gourmet live together for
two weeks prior to filming. &quot;We started with the fact that Igor thinks himself
innocent -- that is, that he does bad things in total innocence,&quot; explain the
siblings (who often speak of their work in a single voice). &quot;We asked ourselves how
he could be driven to feel guilty about what his father did, and about the entire milieu
to which he belonged, to the point where he would tell the truth. We decided he would have
to go all the way, in other words, he would have to say 'I'm guilty of everything.' This
guilt allows him to escape his father.&quot;</p>

<p>Similarly, to emphasize both the isolation and strength of Amidu's wife Assita, the
brothers separated the actress (who has appeared in numerous films directed by Idrissa
Ouédraogo -- no relation -- in her native Burkina Faso) from the rest of the company.
&quot;She was cold all the time,&quot; remembers Luc, who saw her on stage during a trip
to Africa. &quot;She was not used to eating with utensils. It took her a long time to
adapt, which was good for us, because the film also became a sort of documentary about a
woman who arrives in Europe for the first time... She's a wonderful actress.&quot;</p>

<p>As good as Gourmet is as the conniving schemer Roger, whose idea of bonding is
showering his son with such dubious gifts as an absurdly heavy gold ring and a homemade
tattoo to match his own, the film revolves around the utterly convincing confusion of
Renier's Igor. His is &quot;at once the face of a child as well as that of an of an old
man,&quot; enthuse the directors. &quot;A lot passed across his face, instead of coming
out in words. While we stayed pretty close to the script, Jérémie eliminated a lot of
the dialogue himself. He brought silence to the film, which added tension. We liked that a
lot.&quot; Perhaps the most impressive debut by a teenager since Juliette Lewis' stunning
display of burgeoning sexuality in Martin Scorsese's remake of <i>Cape Fear</i> (sadly,
she's since become a parody of herself), the young Renier shares with her an unstable
mixture of child and adult that draws the viewer quickly and firmly into the drama.</p>

<p>Despite numerous situations that might have tempted filmmakers with less faith in their
material, the Dardennes avoid explicit violence and sex: Amidu is heard falling but not
seen, an evening of drinking in a pub with a woman presumably furnished by his father
(&quot;ever have it off?&quot; he asks coarsely) ends abruptly without conclusion, and a
sexual relationship between Igor and Assita suggested by one of the producers was
immediately vetoed: &quot;That's one of the reasons we didn't choose an older Igor,&quot;
says Luc. &quot;Otherwise, it would have been a story about telling the truth because of
love, or because of lust. There <i>is</i> some sexual desire on Igor's part, but it's not
the main thing. The main thing for us was not that he felt love, but that he felt indebted
to [Assita}.&quot; For much the same reason, the absence of Igor's mother is never
explained. &quot;If there was a mother,&quot; they say, &quot;she would either form a
perverse couple with her husband, with the child as victim, or would tell Igor not to obey
his father. In either case, we wouldn't have our stranger anymore...so as to leave mystery
in the character.&quot;</p>

<p>These and other filmmaking tactics, including a detailed rationalization of the
relationship between character and place that results in the enhancement of each by the
other, makes <i>La Promesse</i> strongly reminiscent of the you-are-there immediacy of the
postwar Italian Neo-Realist movement; that the father-son conflict of its most famous
work, Vittoria De Sica's <i>The Bicycle Thief,</i> is updated and enhanced here is a
direct link to the kind of social consciousness and positive rebellion reflected in the
work of filmmakers and other artists who have strong bonds to their homelands but feel
frustrated and ashamed by developments there.</p>

<p>While as individual strategies this approach may seem excessive, their cumulative
effect is emotionally shattering, as Igor, teetering between adolescence and adulthood, is
forced to make choices born of the extraordinary circumstances of his dilemma.</p>

<p>No fewer than six production companies participated in the creation of <i>La Promesse</i>,
which is an indication of the unique challenges faced by filmmakers in smaller countries
with smaller filmmaking communities. Yet socially responsible cinema is rarely better than
this, and the poetic tawdriness of the surroundings only enhances the struggle for dignity
and moral redemption in the face of larceny and despair. A movie of universal themes and
shared humanity, <i>La Promesse</i> is that rare thing in any moviegoing season, much less
the silly American summer: an intelligent, memorable, resonant experience.</p>
