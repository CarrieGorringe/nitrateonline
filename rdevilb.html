himself caught up in a mayoral race with sinister undertones, physical harassment by the
L.A. Police Department and his employer, and a quarry who is most elusive. Oh, yes, and

<p>It would be too easy -- and too demeaning -- to call Franklin&#146;s film the
African-American version of <em>Chinatown</em>. Certainly <em>Devil in Blue Dress</em>
shares many similarities with Polanski&#146;s 1974 film noir classic. Franklin&#146;s
cinematographer, the accomplished Tak Fujimoto (who usually works with director Jonathan
Demme, one of <em>Devil&#146;s</em> co-producers), has filled each frame with a golden,
yet fading glow, not unlike that found in a 1930s Technicolor print. The look of <em>Devil</em>
is eerily similar to John Alonzo&#146;s work for Polanski, and it carries the same
symbolic charge of moral corruption in full blaze which is on the verge of degenerating
into mere moral decay, but not before it takes someone and/or someone&#146;s ideals with
it. Even though the film&#146;s settings are about a decade apart chronologically (<em>Chinatown</em>
was set in the mid-30s), their thematic preoccupations are similar. It is perhaps best to
think of <em>Devil</em> and <em>Chinatown</em> as companion pieces, because
Franklin&#146;s film fills in the racial gaps that Polanski&#146;s film did not address.
Without descending into the didactic, Franklin takes the audience on two simultaneous
journeys. One is a murder mystery. In the other, the participants have to think about skin
color, literally before they cross a street corner. Rawlins is always conscious of his
race because everyone in 1940s America was conscious of race. For Rawlins, however, the
consciousness remained much closer to the surface because his skin was a visual signifier
of his status in much of white society as the dangerous and exotic Other; as Rawlins bumps
up against the paranoia of certain whites and their reactions to him, the audience
explores the full gamut of white reactions to race, from violence to grudging tolerance,
but the underlying impulse is still the same.</p>

<p>And yet, as portrayed by Washington, Rawlins is not an individual who suffers
discrimination with dignity. Rather, Rawlins does not suffer fools gladly, as one
particularly insufferable member of the LAPD discovers, to his angry surprise. Rawlins
does not walk across the room so much as he glides with quiet confidence, even in the face
of danger. He is clearly a man who wants to feel at home in society, but on his own terms,
and those terms are very basic: employment, homeownership, a stable community and decent
treatment from whites. Washington makes no false steps, especially in what might have been
the most controversial of love scenes; far from acting as a shrinking violent in the face
of interracial romance, his scenes with Beals smolder insofar as they can. </p>

<p>The rest of the cast shines as well. For her part, Beals has literally embodied the
essence of the femme fatale, from the dress sense of Barbara Stanwyck in her
&quot;noir&quot; prime to the same sort of indifference to the trouble she is about to
unleash, even if she might be consumed by it; Beals&#146; performance is undone somewhat
by the way in which the script forces her into a position of extreme pathos at the end. As
a slimy politician, Canadian actor Chaykin is first-rate; his appearance on screen,
although brief, drips with such sinister unctuousness that the urge to take a shower
immediately afterward is not an unreasonable one. It is Cheadle, however, who at times
threatens to undercut Washington&#146;s meticulous work. As the happy-go-lucky and
trigger-happy Mouse, Cheadle&#146;s well-timed and methodical performance keeps the
audience off-kilter, since it is hard to know whether Mouse is merely two bricks short of
a proverbial load or if he is really psychopathic (In one hilarious scene, Mouse justifies
killing one of Rawlins&#146; suspects by explaining, with Mouse-like logic, that there was
no other way to keep the suspect detained at the same time that Mouse had to help
Rawlins). Even Rawlins rightfully questions his own judgment in calling upon this madman
for assistance, despite his inevitable value.</p>

<p>Although the ending doesn&#146;t quite live up to every expectation, <em>Devil In a
Blue Dress</em> has already conveyed its considerable gifts to the audience by that point,
so like Rawlins, who savors the delights of community, its members are probably quite
happy to put their feet up and contemplate the simple joys to be had from a good
old-fashioned murder mystery.</p>
