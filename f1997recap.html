<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="6">1997 Top Ten<br>
</font><em><font face="Verdana" size="1">Feature by <a href="eddie.html" target="_top">Eddie
Cockrell</a>, Posted 9 January 1998</font></em></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Let's get one thing straight right away: if you
respect filmmaking as an art form, are fascinated with the often herculean
behind-the-scenes machinations of even the most pedestrian pictures and just enjoy
spending hour after hour in the dark transported to another place and time, well, then, <i>every
</i>year is a good year for movies.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In that sense, maybe critic isn't the word for what gets done here at Nitrate Online.
Chronicler? Maybe, but from the safety of a home office rather than the thick of a junket.
Cheerleader? Perhaps, but in the best sense of the word (no premiere party coverage or
syndication deals here). Whatever you call it, it means appreciating films at least as
much for their cultural significance as for their entertainment value.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, like all such lists, this is severely subjective, as it must be, because it
is no longer possible to see everything in a given year. And as movies become more like
streetcars, coming and going with mind-numbing regularity, it becomes increasingly
difficult to separate the often low-profile wheat from the tub-thumped chaff, predict
which way the awards winds are blowing and even put a finger on fundamental trends and
messages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So this list doesn't even try, preferring instead to serve as a stream-of-consciousness
survey of high and, uh, not-so-high marks in another enjoyable movie year.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so, to the list:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rboogie.html" target="_top">Boogie Nights</a>. </i>The year's most audacious movie, a
    spicy chronicle of an era that now seems strange and &#150; is this the right word? &#150;
    wondrous. Featuring a career-best performance from Burt Reynolds (who'dve thought?), the
    only obscene element in Paul Thomas Anderson's second feature would be if Oscar turned
    it's back.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top">Titanic</a>. </i>Another lost world, this one heartbreakingly
    class-driven, James Cameron's $200 million-plus epic is perhaps the first art film to pose
    as a disaster saga. The daring balance of clich¾
    d love story and action spectacle pays off handsomely, as does the attention to detail and
    those awesome special effects.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rhereafter.html" target="_top">The Sweet Hereafter</a>. </i>Delicate yet clear-eyed, this
    meditation on loss and grief could be the commercial breakthrough for Armenian Canadian
    director Atom Egoyan, who has adapted Russell Banks' novel into an experience that is at
    once sobering and inspirational.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rcopland.html" target="_top">Cop Land</a>. </i>Writer-director James Mangold (<i>Heavy</i>)
    brings a shrewd fascination with small-town life in the northeastern United States to this
    cautionary fable that should have been longer than it was (how many movies leave <i>that </i>impression?).
    Sylvester Stallone's career-best performance is a thrill.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="fsiff97-2.html#The_Full_Monty" target="_top">The Full Monty</a>. </i>The year's scrappy
    little comedy that could &#150; and did, this second feature from director Peter Cattaneo
    taps into the strong underdog vein that makes for a word-of-mouth smash. The movie gets
    extra credit for clever use of Donna Summer's &quot;Hot Stuff,&quot; in a howlingly funny
    unemployment office scene.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rstarship.html" target="_top">Starship Troopers</a>. </i>One of the best pure sci-fi
    movies in years, this reverent adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's novel continued director
    Paul Verhoeven's distinctly European mix of carnage and comedy spiced with sex. A little
    less fascistic flash would've insured the film a spot atop the year's box office.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rlacon.html" target="_top">L.A. Confidential</a>.&nbsp; </i>Some said it couldn't be done,
    but Curtis Hanson's nuanced adaptation of James Ellroy's dense, stylized prose is the best
    color noir since <i>Chinatown</i>. The film also showcases as many Oscar-caliber
    performances as any other movie of 1997.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Nénette and Boni. </i>Claire Denis is one of the handful of great world filmmakers
    unknown in the United States, and this regionally released drama about the often invisible
    ties that bind headstrong siblings showcases her astonishing intuition with young acting
    talent. The film also features a sublime score from Tindersticks.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rapostle.html" target="_top">The Apostle</a>. </i>Robert Duvall's self-made masterpiece is
    fiery, cocksure independent American filmmaking at its best, charting the odd but sincere
    spiritual journey of a decidedly worldly man of God and a testament to the enduring power
    of rural faith and tradition.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rjackieb.html" target="_top">Jackie Brown</a>. </i>Quentin Tarantino's entertaining film
    stakes out new turf for the influential young filmmaker, who has preserved the
    tough-talking milieu of <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> and <i>Pulp Fiction</i> but relies more on
    dialogue than gunplay to move his stories along. Welcome back, Robert Forster and Pam
    Grier.</font></li>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rpostman.html" target="_top">The Postman</a>. </i>Kevin Costner obviously means well, but
    this ponderous, static epic disembowels a good book in dubious service to jingoistic
    narcissism.</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="ftiff97-3.html#Office_Killer" target="_top">Office Killer</a>. </i>Humorless and sloooow.
    As a filmmaker, Cindy Sherman might be a good still photographer. Maybe.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rbatman.html" target="_top">Batman &amp; Robin</a>. </i>Did anybody buy this heartless,
    by-the-numbers sequel machine?</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rinout.html" target="_top">In &amp; Out</a>. </i>Insultingly improbable and not even very
    funny.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rswitchback.html" target="_top">SwitchBack</a>. </i>When an actor billed well down the
    credit list (R. Lee Ermey) is the only element worth watching, the movie's in trouble.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Gummo. </i>This directorial debut from the writer of <i>Kids</i> is an incoherent,
    useless mess.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Designated Mourner. </i>Everybody makes mistakes, and this spectacularly inept
    stab at experimental filmmaking is a doozy.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rsummer.html" target="_top">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>. </i>Post-post-post modern
    tripe from the writer of <i>Scream</i> (Kevin Williamson) that mistakes its novelty for
    substance.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rkiss.html" target="_top">Kiss the Girls</a>. </i>Only sincere performances from Morgan
    Freeman and Ashley Judd make this predictable genre piece watchable.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a href="rct.html" target="_top">Conspiracy Theory</a>. </i>Mel by numbers, Julia by numbers;
    Cynical, manipulative, disposable.</font></li>
