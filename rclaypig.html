<meta name="description" content="Clay Pigeons - A generation after Dan Aykroyd and Steve Martin created the comically carnal Festrunk brothers, those wild and crazy Czechoslovakian guys whose swingin' bachelor pad was the scene of their fruitless attempts to pick up women (remember the silly hats and fractured hipster gait?), the concept -- if not the execution -- of that gag has been recycled by current &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; players Will Ferrell (the demented cheerleading guy) and Chris Kattan (the swallow-your-tongue funny Keri Strug imitation), who originally created the duo while members of the Groundlings comedy troupe. Moving the act from New York to Beverly Hills, toning down the implied coke snorting (they still rub their noses a lot, though) and adding just enough bizarrely interesting bits of business to fill out 83 minutes (OK, so the window-breaking gag from the trailer is shown twice), A Night at the Roxbury is, like its subjects, an absurdly funny, relentlessly cheerful premise that overstays its welcome by half.">

<p>Joaquin Phoenix and Vince Vaughn cheerfully rebound from their roles as a sadly
imprisoned puppy and reluctant rescuer in the poorly received drama <i>Return to Paradise</i>,
turning up the heat a few clicks in the grisly, noirish <i>Clay Pigeons</i>. Phoenix is
Clay Bidwell, a dumbed-down good ole boy in the heart of beer-guzzling Montana. He leads a
day-to-day existence as a gas station attendant until Earl (Gregory Sporleder), his crazed
best friend, shoots himself and frames Clay, whose sexual peccadillo with his newly-dead
friend&#146;s conniving spouse enmeshes the poor patsy in one helluva a bad hair day.
Vaughan pops in Lester Long, a ten-gallon, truck-driving, womanizing cowboy that befriends
our &quot;hero&quot; and seemingly saves the nebish mechanic from the clutches of Amanda
(British actress Georgina Cates), the heartless and hot-blooded wife of his late friend.
Rounding out the three ring circus is the law. Sheriff Mooney (Scott Wilson), a grizzled
Mayberry authority figure seemingly more at ease shellacking his model wooden boats or
ordering his deputy (appropriately named Barney) not to compromise various crime scenes,
plods through a series of mysterious deaths, never connecting on his own comments to Clay
that the youngster keeps turning after every felony. Janeane Garofalo is Agent Dale
Shelby, a city-sarcastic FBI fireplug, on the trail of a serial killer, who connects the
dots with a deadly serious intensity that would be admired by Hannibal Lecter and Marge
Gunderson.</font></p>

<p>David Dobkin&#146;s debut feature (his earlier small-loop efforts were in music videos
and commercials) from a script by Matt Healy is a quirky, dark comedy in the vein of
Thomas McGuane&#146;s 20-year-old <i>Rancho Deluxe</i> with a dash of Hitchcock&#146;s <i>Strangers
on a Train</i> tossed in for good measure, piling on freshly drawn characters in a
tightly-wound hip mystery smartly photographed (by Eric Edwards, a favorite of director
Gus Van Sant). Hmmm, <i>Strangers on a Plain</i>. The cast grabs the brass ring of
Healy&#146;s twisty-turvy, merry-go-round screenplay while ringmaster -- and Ridley Scott
protégé -- Dobkin allows the oddball characters to feast on a ton of cotton candy. </p>

<p><img src="images/rclaypig-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Clay&#146;s
hum-drum world quickly swirls out of control moments after Amanda tosses a wad of dirt
with a metallic thwack on the coffin of her dearly beloved. His body is barely cold before
Amanda struts her vixen stuff, curling her mouth like a venomous snake at Doc
Holiday&#146;s Tavern, the local pool hall and hangout for the now excessively wound Clay.
(Beware a woman scorned!) When he slaps the tramp silly, Lester admires his gumption and a
new friendship is born. Amanda beds the new man in town, but has to endear a case of
coitus interruptus when her water bed springs a leak and she ends skinny dipping in a bare
lake nearby. It&#146;s actually Bear Lake where the tenuous fishing and billiard buddies
become a threesome when they pull in the catch of the day and the authorities alerted. The
loquacious Lester, feigning his job would be in jeopardy if he is associated with their
discovery, begins feeding the rattled Clay to the sharks. It&#146;s cat and mouse from
here on in as Lester slinks below the surface while Carl keeps dodging the fishhook.
Bodies proliferate at an alarming pace and the plot moves from one cover-up to another as
agent Shelby tries to one up the local yokel lawman and locate the elusive Lester as a
possible alibi for the happy-go-loser Clay.</p>

<p>It&#146;s a smart movie, if a little too long in time and cheek. An admirable film
debut that is a good companion piece to Jake Kasdan&#146;s initial effort with <i>Zero
Effect</i> earlier this year, both showcasing fine casts in cutting edge, refreshing
stories. Director Dobkin has a mad touch of counterpoint with some of his musical
selections, including amusing scenes using &quot;It&#146;s Now or Never&quot; and, later,
&quot;Moon over Montana.&quot; There are wailing violins, banjos, skylines, clouds, and
deadpan entertainment. Fine stuff in my book. No gutter humor here, just a veritable
country-and-western serial murder comedy. Yeehaw!</p>
