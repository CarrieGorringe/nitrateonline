<p><big><strong><big>D</big></strong>ancing at Lughnasa</i>, Brian Friel's beautiful,
spirited, powerful stage play about five sisters living in a house in County Donegal,
Ireland, in 1936, has been taken apart, rearranged, and turned into a drowsy domestic
period piece, removing whatever made the material special to begin with and, even, much of
a reason for us to be watching a film version of it at all. There were some very good
reasons why Friel confined the action of his play to the course of one summer's day, with
narration that provided the context for what we were seeing, while placing the now-famous
dance scene in the middle of Act One (if you see the play, you'll understand why this
makes sense). The film's director, Pat O'Connor, who made <i>Circle of Friends</i> and is
swooning around the Irish countryside again, and its screenwriter, playwright Frank
McGuinness, have spread the action out over an indeterminate amount of time, loosening all
the dramatic tension, and everything that was inferred in the play has now been boorishly
spelled out. And the dance scene has been plunked smack dab down at the end of the
picture, like plum pudding at the end of a big feast, with lots of brief, aggravating
hints leading up to it. </big></p>

<p>While Kathy Burke, who on first glance is not one's first choice for a movie actress
(she played the mistreated wife in <i>Nil by Mouth</i>), does some good work as one of the
sisters (the one who has a passion for &quot;Wild Woodbine&quot; cigarettes), two of the
film's best performers are laid very low, indeed: Meryl Streep tries, and fails, to make
much out of a role that reduces her to being a one-dimensional scold; and Michael Gambon,
as the brother who comes home after being desiccated and addled by disease, is used as a
figure of -- ugh! -- comic relief. (I question whether Gambon, the great man who played
Dennis Potter's &quot;Singing Detective&quot;, was fully aware that his performance would
be cut in such a way as to make him look so ridiculous.)</p>

<p>It ends up as the type of moviegoing experience that makes you want to take the
blunderheads responsible out into the street for a few good lashings with a hickory
switch. As it is, I contented myself with the fact that, at just over an hour and a half,
it was short.</p>
