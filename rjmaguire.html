<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>E</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">ver get that sixth sense, watching the coming attractions at
the local googolplex, that the film not only isn't worth your time but looks like
brainless fluff as well? That pretty much describes the trailer for Cameron Crowe's third
feature, the Tom Cruise vehicle <i>Jerry Maguire</i>. See Tom/Jerry stare down his sports
agent colleagues! See Tom/Jerry run through airports with a determined look on his face!
See Tom/Jerry find time to make backlit love to a woman (tasteful yet wildly passionate)!
See Tom/Jerry bond with an adorable kid! And, of course, see the gazillion-watt grin that
Tom uses to make Jerry's go-go ambition palatable to men and women alike, the same grin
that has hung like a cheap suit of clothes on Cruise's soon-to-be-chastised characters
since the morally bankrupt but gleefully frat-housish <i>Risky Business</i> minted <i>that</i>
franchise 13 years ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">To be sure, all of these scenes are in the finished
film (why do some trailers have so much discarded material? Are they saving those bits for
the Criterion laserdisc, or do all first cuts now routinely run three hours plus?), but in
this case don't trust your instincts; <i>Jerry Maguire</i> the trailer is a callous
cocktail that coasts by on lowest common denominator Cruise control, while <i>Jerry
Maguire</i> the film is among the very best contemporary movies about the uneasy
intersection between sports and business as well as the human toll of this peculiarly
American phenomenon. It also finds time to offer pointed opinions on classic jazz, the
talismanic qualities of goldfish, Pete Rose's exclusion from the Baseball Hall of Fame,
support groups, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, child care options, the Dallas Cowboys,
mentors, race relations, celebrity endorsements, the showing of emotion on television talk
shows, ABC Monday Night Football, finding just the right song to howl along with on the
highway and the importance of medical coverage to the employee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Jerry Maguire is a fast-talking, hard-working young
sports agent who works side-by-side with a group of young turks at SMI (Sports Management
International) in Los Angeles. During a tumultuous exposition-laded, terrifically edited
opening credit sequence--note to &quot;serious&quot; filmmakers: see, they're good for
something, as opposed to just starting the film with no sense of focus or pace -- Jerry
has a dark night of the soul and distributes a &quot;mission statement&quot; (&quot;not a
memo&quot;) pleading to shift the focus of the business from the bottom line to hands-on
managing of fewer clients per agent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The memo brings public cheers from his colleagues,
most of whom remain privately cynical. Is there room for the truth? Apparently not; Cruise
is fired by boss Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr), whose unrepentent callousness will make him the
vague focus of Jerry's professional redemption. Stalking out of the office with only a
goldfish and meek accountant Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), Cruise pours his not immodest
energy into two clients, clean-cut college quarterback (and first-round sure thing) Frank
Cushman (Jerry O'Connell) and Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), the tightly-wrapped Arizona
Cardinals wide receiver whose off-the-field histrionics and extended family hijinks
provide much of the film's physical comedy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">When his shepherding of Cushman hits an unexpected
snag, it costs Jerry his relationship with hard-as-nails NFL publicist Avery Bishop (Kelly
Preston) and opens the door to the awkward but inevitable courtship of Dorothy, whose
young son Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki) has taken an immediate liking to the agent--who is
surprised and touched by his own seemingly endless tolerance for the tyke.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The climaxes of the film, such as they are, involve
redemption: Rod learns the importance of singing for his supper in a hysterical send-up of
end zone celebrations that was reportedly choreographed by Paula Abdul (If &quot;Hollywood
Squares&quot; was still on, where d'you think she'd be? Lower right, maybe?); Dorothy's
skeptical, wise-cracking sister Laurel (Bonnie Hunt) makes her peace with their
relationship (&quot;If you fuck this up, I'll kill you,&quot; she tells Jerry); But most
significantly, <i>Jerry Maguire</i> has the courage of its convictions not to be about
Jerry's revenge against SMI, opting instead for a graceful story arc of discovery and
growth followed by an unabashedly sweet fade-out that makes extraordinarily effective use
of Bob Dylan's 23-year-old classic &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; (in fact, the film
features benefits immensely from the shrewdest use of popular music in a Hollywood feature
since Martin Scorsese's <i>GoodFellas</i>). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Remarkably, at 18 minutes over two hours <i>Jerry
Maguire</i> never plays long, due entirely to the informed immediacy and precise balance
of the script. It took writer-director Cameron Crowe , a former journalist with
&quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; three years to write, and the care shows in the depth of the
characterizations and the logic of the plot. Originally conceived as a vehicle for Tom
Hanks, the movie cries out for an actor going through what one character fleetingly refers
to as a pre-mid-life crisis. Shrewdly, Crowe has trusted his instincts to go with relative
unkowns in the large supporting cast, and the gamble has paid off handsomely-- the acting
is uniformly first rate, without a sour note in the entire ensemble. Zellweger is a
revelation of precise comic acting, sort of (as one critic has already alluded to) a
Victoria Jackson without the insecurity and whininess. Little Lipnicki has gotten raves
for his turn as the bespectacled Ray, and his finely-timed scenes with Cruise--sentimental
without once becoming cloying--are indeed the heart of the picture. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">After the impenetrably plotted but ultimately
blockbuster <i>Mission:Implaus</i>--ah, <a href="rmi.html" target="_top"><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a>,
Cruise, an actor known for balancing &quot;important&quot; movies with more mainstream
stories, has cleverly switched the order by starring in (and co-producing) his summer
smash and following up with a movie that looked like another populist parable like <i>Days
of Thunder</i> but plays with as much sincerity and substance as <i>Rain Man</i>. Perhaps
sensing that his brash-young-guy-on-the-come routine was getting a bit fleabitten, Cruise
must've rejoiced at the complexities of Maguire, a guy who wants to change but hasn't a
clue how to go about it with guaranteed success. And it is that very confusion and
vulnerability that separates Jerry from Cruise's other glib creations. A very smart actor,
he saw the need for modification and jumped at it with calculated relish. Could Tom Hanks,
or John Cusack, or Matt Dillon have played Maguire? Sure, but not with the volatile mix of
supermarket tabloid fame and honest talent Cruise brings to the party. Would that have had
an impact on the fragile chemistry of the film? Without a doubt. <i>Jerry Maguire</i>, the
actor's 19th feature, showcases Tom Cruise's best performance to date </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The rest of the ensemble is first-rate, with clever
casting on down the line that includes the Eagles' Glenn Frey as the coach of the
Cardinals (!!!), and brief and/or uncredited turns by Beau Bridges as Cushman's driven
father, conflicted between protecting his young son from the big world and placing him as
the number one draft choice; Eric Stoltz as a fellow SMI agent, flush with the
satisfaction of being young, rich and obnoxious; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann
Wenner as the head of the agency, a quiet but effective Don Simpson lookalike who provides
a rough sketch of a domineering boss. A long list of jocks and jockish celebrities pop up
as well, including Troy Aikman (how prescient this movie looks after the Cowboys' messy,
inevitable playoff demise!), Roy Firestone, and the Gifford/Michaels/Dierdorf trinity of
ABC's noisy, Monday night pigskin party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Crowe is now three-for-three as a hyphenate
filmmaker. His <i>Say Anything...</i> (1989) is a sublime paeon to youthful eighties
exuberance, while <i>Singles</i> (1992), with its stoned-again career-best performance by
Dillon but uneven secondary cast, was unfortunately overlooked but will play far better
with age and the adoration of pop archaeologists seeking the truth about the Seattle
grunge movement (vital then, quaint now--gee, just like punk).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">He's a filmmaker of power on the word processor as
well as the set, writing snappy, screwballish dialogue that plays only in the context of
his seemingly meandering, episodic plots. Look closely, though, and you'll see how
carefully he unites actor and situation: scenes like the awkward elevator ride after Jerry
and Dorothy have left SMI succeed through an intertwined foundation of timing, angles and
performance. Yet an actor in a Cameron Crowe film must be prepared to do things that fly
in the face of conventional narrative: his characters are forever addressing the camera
and declaiming their innermost thoughts in voice-over, the cumulative effect of which is
an anything-can-happen atmosphere and characters of substance etched in lightning-quick
vignettes. That he coaxes such disciplined performances out of newcomers Zellweger and
Lipnicki in particular is proof enought that his sets must nurture an atmosphere of
confidence and control. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Smart without being smart-mouthed, shrewd without
being calculated, and quite obviously the work of a filmmaker with something important to
say and a clear and impish way of saying it, <i>Jerry Maguire</i> is a triumph of nuanced
social satire masquerading as a commercial romantic comedy, a movie that can both make fun
of and wallow in its celebration of the crass spectacle American sport has become.</font></p>
