<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>magine Entertainment changed the title from <em>Mercury
Falling</em> during production of this dull and predictable action picture. Unfortunately,
title changes don't always help and this indifferent star vehicle follows that notion, as
it will head south to video in much the same manner as Willis' <a href="rfifthe.html" target="_top"><em>Fifth
Element</em></a> and <a href="rjackal.html" target="_top"><em>The Jackal</em></a> deep-sixed themselves
last year. It's a cross between <em>Witness</em> (replace an Amish youngster with an
autistic child) and Willis' despondent, renegade John McClane character (replace a gung-ho
New York detective with a veteran hard-edged FBI agent). It doesn't work ... at all. Call
it Witless or call it Die Hardly. Even the ending draws directly from the latter in how it
ultimately deals with the big bad guy.</big></p>

<p>Angering by the mishandling of a militant hostage situation by his superiors, outcast
G-man Art Jeffries (Willis) spends the rest of the movie flashing back to two dead teens
who died as he was working undercover in a pre-credit sequence reminiscent of the Ruby
Ridge fiasco. <img src="images/rmercrising-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="200">While
Jeffries is demoted to mindless wiretapping stakeouts, nine-year-old learning disabled
Simon Lynch, only child and soon to be orphan of a modest Chicago blue collar family, is
hunted by the NSA, the secretive and omnipotent government agency attempting to hide the
boy's ability to decipher a hidden, top secret super-code (the titular Mercury) stuck in
the centerfold of a World of Puzzles magazine. NSA grunts Dean Crandell (Robert Stanton)
and Leo Pedranski (Bodhi Pine Elfman), who placed the word puzzle to filter out the
&quot;geek&quot; factor in the two billion dollar code &#150; which protects covert U.S.
espionage operations around the world &#150; are berated and given a failing grade by
their zealous superior, the over-patriotic Lt. Col. Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin), an
over-the-top and one-dimensional character that reeks of Ollie North. Willis and Baldwin
don't appear in many scenes together (much like Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in 1995's <a href="rheat.html" target="_top"><em>Heat</em></a>), but one that got a chuckle from the audience occurs
in Kudrow's trendy Washington, DC, wine cellar with Jeffries making throw-away comments
tasting several uncorked vintages while he gives his misguided adversary a tactical
ultimatum before trashing a prized wine rack. Guess it was a bad year.</p>

<p>It's strictly cat-and-mouse, with Kudrow's lynchmen, including a presumed-dead special
forces mercenary, Peter Burrell (L.L Ginter), chasing Jeffries and the boy all over
Chicago. As quickly as Jeffries kills off each NSA henchmen, the secret agency manages to
cover its nefarious tracks, picking up its dead agents before anyone notices. At the same
time it spreads misinformation on Jeffries, making him a wanted man among his cohorts and
forcing him to coerce shoe saleswoman Stacey (Kim Dickens, getting more screen presence in
a smaller role after a great performance in Jake Kasdan's <a href="rzeroeff.htm" target="_top"><em>Zero
Effect</em></a>), with his manly charms and openness, enlisting her support in saving the
child. Peter Stormare, who showed us his novel use of a wood-chipper in <em>Fargo</em>,
has a brief (less than two minutes!) appearance before being dispatched to the railbed of
the Chicago Transit Authority.</p>

<p>Chicago-born actor Chi McBride (a four-year regular on <em>The John Larroquette Show</em>)
portrays FBI agent Tommy &quot;Bizzi&quot; Jordan, Jeffries' only friend in the world.
(Hey Jeffries, get a life!) It's the only character that half-way hops off the screen. He
did the same thing last year when he appeared as the garrulous Illinois Gordon in the
dreadful Hoodlum opposite Lawrence Fishburne.</p>

<p><img src="images/rmercrising-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">For all the
movement between Chicago and Washington, there's not much in the way of story and acting.
It's a script-by-number painted with a brush too wide. Director Harold Becker had the same
problem with <em>City Hall</em>, and here muddles through from one scene to the next with
no glue to connect. And this has to be one of the worst photographed films I've seen in
years. It's too dark and you can barely see the cast in many of the scenes, almost as if
this was a unanswered work print. Strange, as director of photography Michael Seresin (a
Becker collaborator 25 years ago with <em>The Ragman's Daughter</em> and more recently
with <em>City Hall</em>) is often associated with some of the better work of director Alan
Parker (<em>Midnight Express</em>, <em>Fame</em>). Guess he's been out in the sun too
long. I know that at a running time of nearly two hours, I was in the theater too long
&#150; nearly two hours too long.&nbsp;</p>
