<p><big><strong><big>&quot;I</big></strong>ndulge me,&quot; urges spoiled, conniving
heiress Celine (Cameron Diaz).</big></p>

<p><big>&quot;Well, if that's what you want,&quot; replies the reluctant hero,
custodian-turned-kidnapper Robert (Ewan McGregor). </big></p>

<p><big>&quot;That's all I ever want,&quot; says Celine tartly. </big></p>

<p>This exchange, perhaps more than any other, sums up the worldview of <i>A Life Less
Ordinary</i>, the frantic, self-conscious and occasionally mean-spirited new movie from
director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald and screenwriter John Hodge, the three hip
kings behind <i>Shallow Grave</i> (1994) and <i>Trainspotting</i> (1996). For their first
American studio effort, the three have managed the not-inconsiderable trick of making a
very self-indulgent movie in an industry where people labor for years to put a personal
stamp on their work. Their right to make such a film in a lowest-common-denominator
marketplace is a question best left to the studio bean counters, who will advise those who
approve such things based on box office performance. That, in turn, will be based on the
ability of audiences to tolerate a wildly uneven, often forced, but occasionally very
funny romp through a classic Hollywood genre &#150; screwball comedy &#150; that really
doesn't work today as well as it did in a more innocent era of moviemaking.</p>

<p><img src="images/rlordinary-1.jpg" alt="angles.jpg (14548 bytes)" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="225">Beginning with a crisis in Heaven (which looks like an update of
the album art for Cheap Trick's &quot;Dream Police&quot;) involving new incentives for a
pair of panicked angels (Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo) to get men and women to fall in
love, <i>Life</i> then introduces the lucky couple assigned by Chief of Police Gabriel
(Dan Hedaya): spoiled rich kid Celine (Diaz), first seen accidentally shooting her fiancé
Elliot (Stanley Tucci) in the head; and Robert (McGregor), a whiny dreamer who loses his
janitor's job to a robot that looks suspiciously like something George Lucas scrapped
early in the <i>Star Wars</i> pre-production period. Introduced when Celine is called into
the office of her tightly-wrapped industrialist father (Ian Holm) at the same time Robert
bursts in with ill-planned demands, the two flee from the resulting chaos and are thrown
together on the road.</p>

<p>So far, so good: these early scenes are bursting with visual and verbal wit, setting
the audience up for a loud, fast and funny update of Frank Capra's <i>It Happened One
Night</i> (1934) seasoned with liberal doses of Coen-ish irony and bits of the classic
1946 Powell-Pressburger fantasy <i>Stairway to Heaven</i> (MacDonald is Pressburger's
grandson). Subsequently, Celine decides that Robert has kidnapped her and after an inept
ransom demand from a pay phone in the middle of nowhere they repair to a deserted cabin to
decide their next move.</p>

<p>It is about here that <i>Life</i> starts to lose it's way, due in large part to the
absurd but jarring violence that the filmmakers subject the pursuing angels to. In fact,
that whole subplot make up the weakest sections of the film, as their interplay is forced
and lame, and at one point Hunter's character is bounced around on a country road and
literally crushed by a pickup truck &#150; only to bounce back with but a few bandages to
indicate her injuries (they're angels, so indestructible, get it?).</p>

<p>Sprinkled throughout this mayhem are scenes of loopy beauty, including a funny scene
with their wilderness neighbor Tod (Maury Chaykin), a spectacularly successful fantasy
karaoke sequence where Robert and Celine sing and dance to Bobby Darin's &quot;Beyond the
Sea&quot; amidst the denizens of a backwoods country bar, and the eventual acknowledgement
of their mutual love (including an odd but whimsical animated sequence over the closing
credits).</p>

<p><img src="images/rlordinary-2.jpg" alt="rkiss.jpg (14735 bytes)" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="225">The film's modest successes can be credited almost entirely to the engaging
presence of the two leads. Diaz is nothing less than terrific, bringing a skewed aplomb to
a character who in lesser hands would be almost entirely unsympathetic. McGregor's comic
timing and puppydog sincerity prevent Robert from being a complete lout, and there hasn't
been a British actor with this distinctive confluence of skills since the early 1970s
heyday of Malcolm McDowell (<i>A Clockwork Orange</i> [1971], <i>O Lucky Man!</i> [1973]).
The rest of the cast is well into the spirit of the proceedings, with standout comic work
coming from Holm, Hedaya, Chaykin and fine stage and screen actress Judith Ivey in a <i>very</i>
small role as Celine's mother (cutting appears evident here). Some miscellaneous
production information lists Sean Connery in an uncredited cameo as God, but there's no
evidence of him in the finished film. Only Hunter and Lindo are at a disadvantage in
poorly focused roles. </p>

<p>&quot;What we wanted to do was combine a British sensibility with some of the wonderful
things about America &#150; its land, its language, its people,&quot; Boyle told
Entertainment Weekly by way of explaining the peculiar tone that <i>Life</i> strikes, for
the most part successfully. Neither fish nor fowl, it isn't British, exactly, but is far
too exaggerated to be mistaken for anything but the most cliched view of rural America.
Hodge acknowledges this: &quot;The first draft was set in Scotland,&quot; he remembers in
the same article, &quot;But the story got so extreme, it just seemed to say, 'Let's go to
America.'&quot;</p>

<p>Note to Boyle and company: it's OK to make fun of America and take stuff from classic
movies, but do not under any circumstances go around telling people you've done this.
First, this strategy won't sell you a single extra ticket, and second, critics will pick
up on whatever you steal anyway and might in fact be grateful that you're not arrogant
enough to actually acknowledge the influence. As for MacDonald's assertion in the same
article that &quot;<i>Trainspotting</i> should have made $35 to $40 million in the U.S.
[the total was $17 million]. Why didn't it? I can only blame the audience, the American
audience,&quot; well, what are moviegoers to make of this? <i>Life</i> isn't a movie, so
much as revenge for <i>Trainspotting</i>'s poor performance? That's no way to work a
crowd.</p>

<p>Decidedly less ordinary than anything else at the multiplex just now, the movie's
problems have more to do with the filmmakers' capricious enthusiasm and seemingly
unfettered vision than their comic abilities. Given their arrogant posturing, coupled with
the withering reviews the film has generated thus far, the deck is stacked against even a
decent box office showing. Even the most sympathetic critic and viewer might find it a lot
easier to indulge these guys if they didn't give the distinct impression of laughing at
them &#150; and everybody else who might wander into this exasperating movie.</p>
