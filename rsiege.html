<p><big><strong><big>M</big></strong>essage films are the bugaboo of directors. So many
competent, even fairly talented directors feel driven to make &quot;statements&quot; with
screenplays that advertise their intentions like a T-shirt slogan, which they invariably
direct with the subtlety of a used car TV ad. There&#146;s nothing wrong with making
meaningful films or addressing weighty topics -- we&#146;d have a much poorer cinema
without such aspirations -- but once a director sets out into such cerebral topics as
&quot;the nature of freedom&quot; he or she had better have a game plan that allows us to
see the ideas at work in dramatic form or the project is doomed to sink under the weight
of it&#146;s own perceived importance.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rsiege-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Edward Zwick set
out to explore the basic rights of American citizens as outlined in the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights, rights that most Americans at roots take for granted yet are daily
suspended from citizens all around the world. And he&#146;s found a topical entry into
that experience, the palpable fear of terrorism brought home in the World Trade Center
bombings not too many years ago. By placing the film in New York, with it&#146;s plethora
of recognizable landmarks, he has the appropriate backdrop to bring those fears home once
again. So far so good. Even after a summer where not one but two outer space threats
destroy picture postcard architecture in comic book plots, the iconic power of New York
perseveres. </p>

<p>Unfortunately New York remains more icon than lived in city under the too-carefully
constructed images of Zwick. Not at first, mind you. For a while the film is a terrific
thriller defined by urban bustle and big city congestion, but as the &quot;big ideas&quot;
becomes more prominent so does Zwick&#146;s sloganeering visual style. At his best
he&#146;s an impressive craftsman, but he still hasn&#146;t the cinematic intelligence to
translate his slick styling and Hitchcock devices to resonant, thoughtful reflection.</p>

<p>Zwick teams up once again with Denzel Washington, the actor he led to an Oscar winning
performance in <i>Glory</i> and directed again in <i>Courage Under Fire</i> (incidentally
Zwick&#146;s two best films). Over the years Washington has imbued his honey smooth tenor
and resolute eyes with a warmth and moral weight. As FBI investigator Anthony Hubbard,
head of the Joint FBI/NYPD Terrorism Task Force, he&#146;s a fiercely determined commander
with a firm authority and easy manner. It&#146;s a part Gregory Peck could have played,
and Washington does no shame to the comparison. </p>

<p>When a terrorist bombing rocks New York he&#146;s at the scene with his partner Frank
Haddad (Tony Shalhoub), an easy-going Lebanese American with a self effacing wit. No one
is hurt and the only message they receive is a with a fax with the obscure demand:
&quot;Set him free.&quot; Just who, Washington and his FBI compatriots don&#146;t know,
and as far as that goes can&#146;t know. We, however, recall the prologue, a military
intelligence trap laid for Sheik Ahmed Bin Tala in a scene that recalls Tom Clancy. Behind
the illegal abduction is a smirking Bruce Willis as General William Devereaux, a ruthless
Army Officer who places national security above law. No one outside of Devereaux&#146;s
circle even knows he&#146;s holding the Sheik -- perhaps a case for plausible deniability,
but the implications go much farther. More in this later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hubbard&#146;s team follows its leads and shadows a suspect abducted by yet
another branch of US security, this time a unit of the CIA led by Elise Kraft (Annette
Bening), a shadowy figure with more than one alias and possibly compromising ties to the
Arab community. Bening plays her character close to the chest but she allows Elise to
suggest, in moments, a moral purpose of her own (which is made explicit later in the film)
and the fears that she&#146;s compromised her own being a little too much in the cause. As
Elise follows a trail of clues through her own network of contacts she keeps showing up at
crime scenes and investigation sites and eventually forms an uneasy alliance with Hubbard.
</p>

<p><img src="images/rsiege-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4 " WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">In one of the best
scenes of the film Hubbard briefs a room full of New York city officials and government
brass on the progress of the investigation into the terrorist bombings of NYC. In the
middle of his speech a beeper goes off. Then another. Soon the room erupts in a chorus of
cellular chirps. It&#146;s a scene that would make Hitchcock proud: there&#146;s been
another bombing, and this time it&#146;s hit the government where it lives. The FBI
building has been leveled and, over the strenuous objections of both Hubbard and
Devereaux, the government calls in the military. Though Devereaux&#146;s arguments are
sound his delivery rings hollow, just as his earlier meeting with Hubbard (who, it turns
out, previously served under Devereaux in the army) is more ominous than informative.
It&#146;s not simply that Devereaux continues to lie about his months long custody of the
Sheik, but he seems to be feeling out the situation. Willis plays him with such smarmy
insincerity that you can&#146;t help but distrust the guy.</p>

<p>Here&#146;s the first instance where Zwick bobbles the film. This isn&#146;t <i>Seven
Days in May</i> and Devereaux isn&#146;t plotting some coup but he seems to have some
master plan, whether it be a ridiculously elaborate scheme to keep his own activities
secret or a xenophobic plot to round up the &quot;dangerous&quot; Arab-Americans into a
modern concentration camp. Neither of these motivations are justified by the story but he
proceeds to fulfill both to the letter. Within 48 hours of the order the American army has
sealed of Manhattan and soldiers patrol the streets. New York has come under martial law
and the constitution suspended and Devereaux sets himself up as a tin god dictator,
barking out patriotic sound bites behind a face of self satisfied calm. It&#146;s a fine
setup for a military thriller, but in the context of this film it&#146;s merely
distracting: is he the good soldier corrupted by power or the conniving power-mad patriot
turned into a would-be Napoleon? Zwick isn&#146;t telling, and I don&#146;t think he
really knows.</p>

<p>Zwick&#146;s visualization of occupied Manhattan is both eerie and obvious, recalling
everything from WWII Germany to modern day Beirut without actually resonating anything
deeper than this simple identification. We recognize the sloganeering images of barbed
wire holding camps and military patrols on city streets, but they seem more &quot;Twilight
Zone&quot; than Ten O&#146;clock News despite Zwick&#146;s heavy use of video and TV
telecast imagery. Even in his insistent use of familiar NYC landmarks (most notably the
platoons of soldiers marching over the Brooklyn Bridge, which was used for the poster and
has in many ways become the defining image for the picture) and his more general evocation
of modern American streets in his location shooting, he never brings the war home. These
snapshots of America under army occupation have more verisimilitude than, say, the cold
war allegories of <i>Red Dawn</i> or the miniseries <i>Amerika</i>, but in the pulp
outrageousness of Milius&#146; paranoid fantasy and the somber, cold execution of <i>Amerika</i>
(shot in the drab, drained colors usually reserved for winter dramas -- or films shot in
Russia) there&#146;s a quirky literary conceit that works better. </p>

<p><img src="images/rsiege-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">Zwick is so intent
on making his grand point that he forgets to plunge us into the experience -- we never
feel what it&#146;s like to be in the thick of it. Haddad, whose American son is rounded
up in patrol sweeps, should be our entry. Tony Shalhoub inflects Haddad with an
understated charm and quiet presence, but in his scenes with Washington the character
actor is eclipsed by Washington&#146;s movie star authority, just as his character is
ultimately little more than an appendage to Hubbard -- loyal friend and colleague with a
crisis in faith (in America, not Islam). We don&#146;t even meet Haddad&#146;s family
until after his son has been rounded up in a military sweep -- just another nameless
bystander. Did Zwick think we couldn&#146;t identify with a Palestinian-American?</p>

<p>While TV images of a protest against martial law show the people of New York band
together (&quot;Look at this,&quot; remarks one Arab character, in case we don&#146;t get
it, &quot;Arabs and Jews, side by side&quot;), the film loses its credibility as
commentary on racism by refusing to treat the sea of Arab-American bystanders as anything
more than a herd of extras. The film spends much more time on the minutia surrounding the
actions of the Arab bad guys than even sketching a normalcy for the thousands of citizens
we see only once they&#146;re penned in makeshift corrals. As far as Zwick is concerned
the very image of these citizens in concentration camps should be enough to provoke
outrage, and he&#146;s right, but by concentrating all his cinematic efforts on showing
every Arab character as a threat to American security (with the notable token exception of
Haddad) of he undercuts his own efforts. </p>

<p>Where the film works is in the simple nuts and bolts thriller elements, which actually
becomes more interesting against the background of a police state. When Devereaux takes
control of Manhattan his surface sheen of concerned soldier cracks and reveals a
megalomaniac underneath -- or at least that&#146;s what Willis&#146; performance tells us.
(When Elise comments &quot;Have you ever met someone so in love with the sound of his own
voice,&quot; you&#146;ve got to wonder if she&#146;s referring to the character or the
actor, whose tough talking patriotic sound bites are accompanied by a self satisfied
expression.) But</p>

<p>as the FBI continues its investigation, shadowed by military intelligence, Zwick
creates a fascinating thriller and for the only time in the film really gives a flavor --
however spy story oriented -- of the workings of a police state. Justice is no longer
subject to law but a matter of power and purpose.</p>

<p>As a slick spy thriller/detective story <i>The Siege</i> has promise. Zwick has
blossomed into a talented craftsman and his technique serves the thriller well. But as a
cautionary drama <i>The Siege</i> is flatfooted and false, a Rorschach test of images
mixed and matched for gut reactions. But the high minded ideals and the images don&#146;t
meet in anything more than rhetorical speeches delivered by Washington&#146;s Hubbard. In
his misguided literalness, Zwick has shown us the face of a police state without exposing
its core.</p>
