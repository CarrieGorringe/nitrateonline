<p><font size="5"><strong>A</strong></font><font size="4"> bracing return to the glory
years of a very specific strain of American independent filmmaking from the 1960s and
1970s, this second directorial effort from Nick Cassavetes (<i>Unhook the Stars</i>) is
marked by his funky yet reverent realization of a two decade old script by his father John
as well as uniformly brassy and spectacular acting. Although the film is heavy going for
the uninitiated, those new to the Cassavetes worldview are advised to stick with it:
there's never a dull moment in this raucous, combustible, uneven but ultimately thrilling
meditation on love and madness.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/rlovely-1.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="187">In the dingy
corridors of an archetypical urban flophouse, a lean, wobbly bottle blond weaves from her
door to the payphone and back again. This is Maureen (Robin Wright Penn) pregnant and
distraught over the disappearance of her short-tempered, lowlife husband Eddie (Sean
Penn). To fill the time until he comes back, Maureen has some laughs in the local bar with
their hulking neighbor Kiefer (James Gandolfini), an adventure that ends in him beating
her up when she won't put out. Eddie comes back, and since these kids, warts and all, are
crazy in love, <i>crazy</i> in love, she delays telling him as long as possible. Once he
figures it out he goes crazy <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#151;</font> <i>really</i>
crazy <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#151;</font> and is put away in a mental
institution.</p>

<p>Ten years later, Maureen's a brunette housewife married to the equally volatile Joey
(John Travolta). Their suburban veneer succeeds in masking their willful tempers from
their three daughters, the oldest of which, Jeanie (Kelsey Mulrooney), is Eddie's.</p>

<p>Thinking he's only been gone for three months and still crazy in love with Maureen (but
maybe not so <i>crazy</i> crazy anymore), the meek and newly-sprung Eddie visits a hair
salon (in the film's oddest sequence), emerging with blond locks to square off with Joey
over custody of Maureen, who isn't as torn over her choice as one might think.</p>

<p>Loving, fighting, smoking, drinking, living: these are the parameters of the unique
movie universe of John Cassavetes, the strong-willed and iconoclastic American independent
filmmaker (<i>Husbands</i>, <i>A Woman Under the Influence</i>) and actor (<i>The Dirty
Dozen</i>, <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>) whose heady mixture of Method and <i>cinéma verit<font face="Times New Roman Special G1">Å</font> </i>served to forge a completely unique style
of acting and directing that sprung from the same well as the work of Jean-Luc Godard,
Andy Warhol, and Jacques Rivette and provided key inspiration to Robert Altman, Ken Loach,
Martin Scorsese and other then-young and independent-minded filmmakers.</p>

<p>Cassavetes' films are also about family, the often exasperating interactions among
lovers, siblings and spouses who are often clogged with equally inarticulate reservoirs of
love and rage. In that respect, <i>She's So Lovely</i> fits right in to the ouevre: Eddie
and Maureen's barfly pals are as privy to the protracted arguments and reconciliations as
the married couple themselves, and there's never much thought given to permanent
separation: &quot;when you mess someone up,&quot; goes one line of the film's seductive
gutter poetry, &quot;you mess 'em up for life.&quot;</p>

<p>Each and every performance sings with the raw energy of a downed power line, flopping
and sputtering and just daring you to make a connection (this swollen prose is indicative
of how the movie makes you think). Penn's volcanic performance &#151; hiding beneath a
fragile dome one moment, suddenly venting steam and erupting the next &#151; earned him
the Best Actor award at this year's Cannes festival, and the honor is well-deserved. <img src="images/rlovely-2.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="250">For a guy who pops up once
or twice a year to announce he's not acting anymore, Penn has put together a string of
performances that are, taken individually, often inscrutable. But put together they speak
eloquently of a channeled rage and a desire to be something more &#151; more responsible,
more articulate, more anything &#151; that seems to mirror the actor's stormy and often
very public life. Coming on the heels of his Oscar-nominated performance in <i>Dead Man
Walking</i>, his almost mystical turn in the still-to-be-released <i>Hugo Pool</i> (the
genial return of beloved cult director Robert Downey, Sr.) and his hard-nosed, knowing
direction of the tragically misunderstood <i>The Crossing Guard </i>&#151; the best film
of 1995 &#151; and in that anticipatory period just before David Fincher's <i>The Game</i>
and Oliver Stone's <i>U-Turn</i> are unveiled (Telluride audiences will see the latter
this weekend), Penn is at once as ubiquitous in and as palatable to an often suspicious
Hollywood as he's ever been. Couple that with the charming but exasperating mixture of
naivete and worldliness he presents to writer Scott Raab in the September issue of GQ
(imitations of his good friend Marlon Brando, ruminations on the &quot;little marble in
his head&quot;) and it's clear that Eddie is a character close to Penn's heart. So close,
in fact, that the young Penn promised Cassavetes <i>pere</i> that he'd one day play the
part.</p>

<p>Robin Wright Penn's performance has the same raw fearlessness as her overlooked but
powerful turn opposite Tom Hanks in <i>Forrest Gump</i>, and the real-life mutual
attraction between the couple is a mystery no longer. Travolta might overstay his welcome
as the unstable tough guy whose charm is controlled by some spiritual spigot, but until
that happens he's smart enough to take roles like the hair-trigger Joey &#151; who doesn't
even show up until the second half of the film but provides a formidable foil for Eddie's
stubborn scheme. And its a pure pleasure to see the great Harry Dean Stanton at the top of
his game once again as Eddie's droll sidekick Shorty, who gets the movie's funniest line
(&quot;Hey Joey, we came for dinner, whattaya pullin' a piece for, it's not that kind of
an evening&quot;) during the comical climactic showdown between the battling daddies.
Unfortunately for it's commercial chances, the movie doesn't seem to have a third act and
just sort of stops, leaving a lot of issues unresolved. This, too, is a Cassavetes
strategy, as the script reflects the unpredictable cadences and unexpected (and largely
unexplainable) truces of life its own bad self.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, Cassavete's would've taken on Eddie's inconsistencies with relish,
the gleam in his eye and smirk in his smile at once seducing and maddening to his loved
ones. Come to think of it, his wife Gena Rowlands (star of son Nick's <i>Unhook the Stars</i>
and a prison psychologist here) could've played Maureen, with regulars Peter Falk, Ben
Gazzara and Seymour Cassel essaying the other lead roles. There aren't many published
photos of Cassavetes <i>pere</i> at work, but one of the most evocative is a shot of the
director in a recording studio with Charles Mingus, hands stretched skyward, eyes and
mouth wide open, reacting in obvious ecstasy to the musician's score for his debut film <i>Shadows</i>
(1960). One would like to think that Nick had as much fun making <i>She's So Lovely</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rlovely-3.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="250">A brief warning
about the television trailer for the film: Joseph Vitarelli's score is quite good and the
songs chosen by Music Supervisor Amanda Scheer Demme are at once clever and discreetly
complimentary (Bjork's &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; over the opening credits is a stroke
of pure genius), but the trailer's music bed, Third Eye Blind's &quot;Semi-Charmed
Life,&quot; is <i>not</i> in the film &#151; although the riffing white boy raps of
songwriter Stephan Jenkins provide a perhaps unintentional stylistic link to the film's
rhythm. Nevertheless, the annoyingly edited trailer portrays this as some sort of Labor
Day weekend feel-good comedy &#151; and while that may lure people in short-term, it
creates an artificial reputation for the film that is patently false (the same stunt was
pulled with <i>Muriel's Wedding</i>, surprising those who remembered the hype and rented
the tape based on that).</p>

<p>A lot of people think that what's missing from movies today is a distinctive
storytelling voice, a worldview unfiltered by the suits and committees responsible for a
large percentage of the entertainment out there. A bracing antidote to that blandness, <i>She's
So Lovely</i> is at once exasperating and mesmerizing, a truly independent vision in a
world of increasingly calculated art and the best gift a son could ever give to a father
whose legend looms large and whose formidable talents are missed more each day.</p>
