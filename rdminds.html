<p><em><font size="5"><strong>D</strong></font><font size="4">angerous Minds</em>,
according to the press release sitting on my desk, &quot;is a provocative and exciting new
drama about the battles that are waged and lost every day in America's classrooms and the
fight to combat despair and defeat.&quot; The film is loosely based upon LouAnne Johnson's
experiences as a former Marine-turned-teacher-of-the-disadvantaged as recounted in the
book, <em>My Posse Don't Do Homework</em>. As it turns out, that Marine Corps training
comes in handy, as we witness Ms. Johnson's gradual attempts to formulate safe zones,
beginning with her own physical safety (her karate skills are helpful here), and expanding
to encompass her students' minds and their lives. She attempts to rescue them, first from
their own ignorance, then from the ignorance of an educational bureaucracy which
understands the concept of warehousing what it believes to be the academically inept but
has an extreme reluctance to innovate, and finally from the alienation of the very hostile
world of the inner cities. </font></p>

<p>At least, this is how the film should have played, but it falls critically short of the
mark, for reasons that will become apparent. In all fairness, the film succeeds in
conveying some of the problematic aspects of education reform. How, for example, can a
teacher honestly expect his/her students to adopt middle-class values of delayed
gratification in the pursuit of knowledge when their post-school lives are literally spent
in a milieu akin to wartime behavior, consisting mainly of a live-by-your-wits paranoia
which advocates living for today in case you die tomorrow? Unfortunately, the film doesn't
spend that much time upon this central problem, using it instead as an excuse to emphasize
the individual heroics of Ms. Johnson. While her conduct was commendable beyond any doubt,
Ms. Johnson herself would be the first to say that the solution to the education problem
(as the film seems to suggest) is not simply to staff the teaching profession with
ex-Marines who would be happy to impart their expertise and self-discipline for a salary
of $24,700 per year (this fact alone begs the question of how the cinematic Ms. Johnson, a
divorcée who lives in a rundown house, can afford to give gifts of leather jackets and
expensive dinners to her students as educational incentives on such a salary). Instead of
asking why such people don't offer these qualities to the school board of their choice,
one might well ask: why should they, or anyone else, sell such precious (because rare)
commodities so cheaply in a society driven less by altruism than by market forces? Further
to the point, can and should education be driven by market forces? In fact, Ms. Johnson
has answered those latter questions very much in the negative; her success, as she has
been quick to indicate in her books and personal appearances (if not on the screen), was
very much due to generous government grants. This is not to suggest that the educational
problem in the U.S. inner cities can be solved merely by throwing more money at the
problem, but, if Ms. Johnson's example is any indication, it surely cannot be solved by
the fiscal equivalent of cynicism disguised as &quot;tough love&quot;. From the attitude
of the film, however, anyone would be forgiven for assuming otherwise. </p>

<p>Moreover, any attempt (and there isn't much) to address these issues becomes obscured
by several defects within the film, not least of all by the fact that the characters are
drawn as one-dimensional figures. According to Ms. Johnson, who spoke after the screening
I attended, many of the characters in the film are &quot;composites,&quot; created from
compressing two or more real-life figures into one. Granted, this construction allows the
scriptwriter a choice of more exciting incidents than would be available in the life of
one individual, but it also squeezes the richness out of those lives utilized in the
process. This character construction shouldn't be surprising, since the film was produced
by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, names which should be familiar to anyone who has
seen <em>Top Gun</em> or <em>Days of Thunder</em>, -- films that are not renowned for
their emphasis upon the construction of multifaceted characters. In fact, <em>Dangerous
Minds</em>, for all of the seriousness of the issues it attempts to address, actually
bears an uncanny resemblance to <em>Top Gun</em>. As anyone who has sat through one of
Simpson and Bruckheimer's films knows all too well, they are all constructed in the same
way: scenes of violence are interspersed with scenes of the hero or heroine, beautifully
lit, as he/she is involved in a solitary struggle to conquer not only his/her own demons,
but the demons of those around them. All of the above, of course, is covered with a thick
impasto of bombast strong enough to deprive the narrative of air without actually killing
it. (Pfeiffer's rendition of LouAnne Johnson bears all the hallmarks of this mixture of
externally-manifested angst and cheesecake. In one scene, she lies in bed, languorous
sensuality at the forefront, earnestly contemplating the future of a troubled student
while clad only in a Levi's shirt; the effect is not unlike Victoria's Secret meets Mother
Teresa, but more pleasing visually). Under the circumstances one can hardly discuss the
concept of a unique directorial voice; put a relative unknown like Smith (a Canadian
director who made the acclaimed TV-film, <em>The Boys of St. Vincent's</em>) and/or Tony
Scott at the helm of a Simpson/Bruckheimer film and the results can be depressing, because
so similar. </p>

<p>Despite the monotonous tendentiousness so prevalent in a Simspon/Bruckheimer film, it
should nevertheless be said that sometimes this balancing act between narrative life and
death can be entertaining, such as in the case of <em>Crimson Tide</em>; in the case of <em>Dangerous
Minds</em>, however, it is simply too oversimplified and therefore ridiculous. It's
obvious that the boys work better with military hardware, probably because the bombast
just slides right off the coating of those F-18 fighters or nuclear subs, or maybe
civilians just have an endemic belief in military types as being, well, somewhat more
unbalanced than the rest -- call it the <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> Syndrome. After hearing
Ms. Johnson speak about her life and writings, and determining for myself the amount of
detail lost in the translation from book to screen, the result seemed somewhat less than
expected. Nevertheless, the performances are surprisingly good, given the quality of the
script that the actors had to work with (visibly uncomfortable in early scenes, Pfeiffer
grows into her role nicely as the film progresses). Ms. Johnson's verdict on the film was
that it wasn't bad -- for a Hollywood production. She should have traced her discontent to
a more specific source, or, one should say, more specific sources. </p>
