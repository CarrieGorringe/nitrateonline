<p><font size="5"><strong>&quot;R</strong></font><font size="4">emember, everyone, this is
a <i>cartoon</i>,&quot; actor John Glover recalls director Joel Schumacher exhorting his
troops prior to key takes for <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i>, the fourth installment in the
tremendously successful Warner Bros. franchise of films (and, of course, related
merchandise) based on the famed, angst-ridden Caped Crusader and his dedication to the
protection of the perpetually endangered Gotham City. That Schumacher and the studio brain
trust have a very firm idea what the Batman juggernaut should be was resoundingly
reaffirmed by the canny instincts of the enjoyably trashy <i>Batman Forever</i> (1995),
which jettisoned once and apparently for all the mopey but provocative original vision of
Tim Burton (1989's <i>Batman</i>, 1992's <i>Batman Returns</i>) in favor of a labyrinthine
neon netherworld and a more familial approach to the material. Yet as the formula becomes
inevitably more predictable -- and thus, by definition, more closely aligned to the spirit
of childhood days spent idly flipping through lurid twelve-cent sagas which offered simple
moral dilemmas and convenient, action-based solutions -- the opportunity to remake this
venerable superhero for these jittery pre-millennium times seems to be slipping away.
Individual reaction to this conscious decision will ultimately dictate the degree to which
the average moviegoer enjoys this effects-laden extravaganza.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/rbatman-1.gif" alt="Bat Trio" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="200">After
agreeing to work together to protect Gotham at the end of <i>Batman Forever</i>, Bruce
Wayne/Batman (George Clooney, replacing Val Kilmer) and Dick Grayson/Robin (Chris
O'Donnell) must now maintain their increasingly uneasy truce in the face of threats by the
diabolical Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who in turn pursues an uneasy
criminal alliance with Pamela Isley/Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), an earnest environmentalist
transformed into a deadly femme fatale by the machinations of her bushy boss (Glover). She
achieves her goals of clouding men's minds with the help of the grotesquely muscled Bane
(Jeep Swenson), the bizarre product of an experiment gone awry. Balancing the evil on hand
is Barbara Wilson/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone), who arrives unannounced from her studies
at &quot;Oxbridge&quot; to find her uncle Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough) slowly
succumbing to a mysterious illness. The drama plays itself out through non-stop action
set-pieces that melt into one another with only perfunctory stops for narrative.</p>

<p>As is the norm in the comic book universe, each of the new characters has an extensive
backstory: Freeze is a tragically deformed scientist imprisoned in a glowing cryosuit who
now splits his time between mourning his wife's tragic fate (she's floating in a large jar
until he can find a cure for her &quot;McGregor's Syndrome&quot;) and scheming to destroy
the city; Ivy, with blood of aloe and skin of chlorophyll, also packs a poisonous kiss and
seems to want revenge on those who befoul the planet and untrustworthy men in general; and
Bane... well, although given the niftiest creation sequence in the film, much of the
history of this creature, who looks like a Mexican wrestler, is left unexplored --
although there are ancillary comic books that apparently flesh this out in some detail. </p>

<p><img src="images/rbatman-2.gif" alt="Freeze and Ivy" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="133">The film trusts the audience to remember why the title characters do what they
do, and even fetishizes the essential absurdity of the superhero costume thing with a
opening credit sequence montage that emphasizes the sections of anatomy teenaged girls buy
tickets to see (the boys get equal time later in the movie when Batgirl first suits up).
This emphasis on raging hormones at the expense of Burton's exploration of the macabre
(remember the yucky black saliva of Danny DeVito's Penguin?) is still relatively new,
having been introduced by Schumacher in the previous film and refined here to embrace a
good-natured competition between Robin and Batgirl as well as the former's undisguised
lust for both his partner in crime-fighting and Poison Ivy, who promises and delivers him
his own bat signal in exchange for a lethal lip lock. </p>

<p>All of this is presented in the dazzling, vertiginous style that marks Schumacher as a
reverent emulator of a true comic book. Regrettably, the murky metropolis that is Gotham
City, not to mention the cavernous, pitch-black Wayne Manor and barely-glimpsed Batcave,
bear no spatial relationship to each other and thus exist as the kind of freeze-frames
that make for exciting comic books but disorienting and disjointed movies. Schumacher
helps himself not a bit by jettisoning such mainstays of the television show as
Commissioner Gordon's office (although venerable character actor Pat Hingle is back for a
fourth turn as the blustery cop), the space between Wayne Manor (hard to say without
&quot;Stately&quot; in front of it...) and the Batcave, which is reduced to not much more
than a fog-filled garage for the once-again retooled but underexplored Batmobile. There's
a new emphasis on gadgets, with lasers, the inevitable outlandish guns and a sort of
Bat-weed-whacker taking center stage. Having said this, Barbara Ling's dense production
design looks to be terrific, but apparently the desired effect was to make it impossible
to see anything well enough or long enough for details to register. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>The thinly-veiled messages of trust, family values and good citizenship embodied by the
heroes (and heroine) of Batman &amp; Robin are tempered with the increasingly frantic
style of the film as well as its easily digestible storyline and largely inoffensive plot
points. The script, credited to Akiva Goldsman but apparently shored up by Oscar-winning
writer Christopher McQuarrie (<i>The Usual Suspects</i>), distills word balloon bon mots
to their essential form, moving the story forward with exclamations such as &quot;The
Iceman cometh!,&quot; &quot;your supreme ruthlessness,&quot; &quot;I heard you were
blue,&quot; &quot;Tonight hell freezes over!,&quot; and the inevitable &quot;Let's kick
some ice!&quot;</p>

<p><img src="images/rbatman-3.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="206">Clooney's Batman,
while more human than Kilmer's or Keaton's (much is made of his ability to actually
smile), is still a direct offshoot of his Doug Ross of <i>E.R.</i>, which is to say
he&#146;s an unstable mixture of soulful compassion and fierce ideals. That he doesn't do
that neck thing all the time is less a function of his characterization than it is a
restriction of the rubber suit, which keeps his head relatively straight. O'Donnell
continues his earnest read of Robin's gee-whiz enthusiasm in the best Burt Ward tradition,
tempered by a twentysomething penchant for extreme games and adolescent emotions.
Silverstone's Batgirl is mannered yet refreshing in her plainness, while Thurman seems to
be having a ball vamping it up as the malevolent Poison Ivy. The top-billed
Schwarzenegger, who delivers such lines as &quot;for dey are harbingers of yohr
duhme&quot; and &quot;your heart will freeze and beat no moah&quot; with gusto but little
conviction, nevertheless summons some unexpected pathos and gets a good jab at Steven
Spielberg's competing summer blockbuster. Supermodels Elle Macpherson (as Bruce Wayne's
long-suffering significant other Julie Madison) and the floating Vendela are largely
decorative, and blinking will rob the viewer sights of Vivica Fox and Coolio. </p>

<p>Where does the franchise go from here? Up, apparently. At this writing a popular
scenario making the rounds of gossip columns tells of Tim Burton directing Nicolas Cage as
Superman in a big-budget action film that may or may not feature Jim Carrey as Brainiac
and, in a walk-on cameo, Michael Keaton as Batman. Whether the competition between the two
is antagonistic or synergistic remains to be seen, fuelled no doubt by the degree of
success this film exhibits; remember, Burton's <a href="rmarsattacks.html" target="_top"><i>Mars
Attacks!</i> </a>was a poorly-timed oddity and the director, fleetingly referred to in <i>Batman
Forever</i> (the &quot;Dr. Burton&quot; at the wisely-reprieved Arkham Asylum) and listed
as an executive producer, doesn't appear to have been involved in <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rbatman-4.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="200">&quot;If you think
it, you can do it,&quot; Schumacher told a journalist earlier this year, &quot;But you've
got to build something fantastic.&quot; <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> is fantastic, if not
particularly inspired, and seems sure to be a hit for the very reasons that may disenchant
many moviegoers. Undoubtedly a logistical triumph for everyone involved, the franchise
will nevertheless forever be limited by its broad appeal, and those offshoots stemming
from that appeal: namely, self-replication and mass merchandising. The challenge is to
balance the already-rampant self-parody with genuine surprise (they're using up the good
villains at an alarming rate). But as calculating as the entire phenomenon may seem, on
the strength of its distinctive special effects and short-attention-span aesthetic, the
film itself is fervently faithful to the teenaged diversions that inspired it. There are
numerous good reasons, lavishly evident here, why the next installment has already been
titled <i>Batman Triumphant</i>.</p>
