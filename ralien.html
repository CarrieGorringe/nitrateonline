<p><big>&quot;Was it everything you hoped for?&quot; the newly constituted Lieutenant
First Class Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) asks a stunned group of hardcases who've just
had a harrowing firsthand encounter with one of the hydroponic aliens she's been fighting
on and off throughout the galaxy in frenzied bursts for in excess of two and a half
centuries. In truth it is: the crafty continuation of a movie franchise at once rousing
and reflective &#150; genetics have been added to the traditional mix of greed, glop and
guns &#150; <i>Alien Resurrection</i> goes about its gooey business with a renewed sense
of purpose and a maliciously funny and audience-friendly appreciation of the perpetual
peril the put-upon heroine once again finds herself in.</big></p>

<p>Two hundred years after Ripley's unfortunate fate on Fiorina 161, a team of scientists
circling Pluto on the top-secret United Systems Military research station <i>Auriga</i>
have successfully cloned her (after seven false starts) in order to birth a baby Queen for
study and eventual domestication of the species. Following that successful procedure, the
new Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), whose DNA is entwined with that of her enemy, becomes a
disposable commodity to corrupt General Perez (Dan Hedaya) and surgical team leaders Wren
(J.E. Freeman) and Gediman (Brad Dourif).</p>

<p>Into this already-tense mix sails the <i>Betty</i>, a dilapidated freighter manned by a
scruffy group of mercenaries, prominent among whom are leader Elgyn (Michael Wincott),
wise-cracking goon Johner (Ron Perlman), paralyzed mechanic Vriess (Dominique Pinon) and
spooky, waif-like mechanic Annalee Call (Winona Ryder). After conducting their nefarious
business of selling warm, presumably pilfered bodies to Perez for alien research, all hell
breaks loose as the aliens escape their pens, the pirates commandeer the <i>Auriga</i>,
and a mad scramble is on to reach the dubious safety of the <i>Betty </i>&#150; every
thing for itself &#150; as the conjoined vessels approach earth on a pre-programmed
distress course.</p>

<p>With hair as limp and straggly as her new, listless approach to life, Ripley is
literally a shadow of her former self, a cynical shell who in the course of her long
voyage of despair has been screwed over by larcenous systems, devious people (human and
synthetic) and capricious fate to the point where her every movement is numb reaction to
the horror around her that just won't stop. &quot;I don't even really think Ripley is that
strong,&quot; Weaver reveals. &quot;[Although] she may be in this one, because she is ...
different.&quot;</p>

<p>The inventive original screenplay of Joss Whedon (<a href="rtoystry.html" target="_top"><i>Toy Story</i></a>,
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, uncredited work on <a href="rtwister.html" target="_top"><i>Twister</i></a>,
<a href="rwaterwrld.html" target="_top"><i>Waterworld</i></a> and <i>Speed</i>) has invigorated the
franchise through bold black humor and a genuinely legitimate resolution of the
provocative yet somehow cheap climax of the previous entry that takes the entire notion of
Ripley vs. the mysterious species (nobody's ever bothered to give them a name, save <i>Aliens</i>'
half-hearted &quot;xenomorph&quot;) to entirely new and, ahem, fertile levels. &quot;Being
asked to do an <i>Alien</i> movie was like being offered the Grail,&quot; he remembers.
&quot;I grew up on them. Being a fan helps because I was one of those guys sitting on my
couch saying 'they should let me write an <i>Alien</i> movie.' And they did, so I had the
opportunity to really sit down and think, how do I satisfy myself as a fan?&quot;</p>

<p>Whedon's solution to the tricky question of how to bring Ripley back from the dead was
OK with Weaver, who'd had enough (thus the ending of <i>Alien3</i>) and was ready to bail
altogether (this is the second film in the franchise on which she's gotten a co-producer
credit). &quot;I remember sitting in one of the exec's offices and they said they were
writing this script, and I was stunned frankly because one of the reasons I died was
really to liberate this series from Ripley, 'cause I didn't want her to keep waking up,
'Oh my god, there's a monster on board.' I didn't want her to become like this figure of
fun that no one ever listened to and kept waking up in one situation worse than the next.
So for the sake of the series and also because I heard they were going to do <i>Alien vs.
Predator</i>, something I thought sounded awful, I wanted out... They told me they were
writing a new draft and that I would find it very provocative how I was brought back... I
thought it was amazing.&quot; One question: who is this &quot;they&quot;? Does United
Systems Military (formerly the &quot;Company&quot;) control everything now?</p>

<p>Reinvigorating the look of <i>Alien Resurrection</i> is the sensibility of French
director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, whose previous films <i>Delicatessen</i> (1991) and <i>The
City of Lost Children</i> (1995) point directly to the familiar yet exotic and new
confines of the <i>Auriga</i> and the <i>Betty</i> (which have the same spooky, almost
Victorian feel as the interior of Orson Welles' magnificent Amberson mansion) as well as
strange obsessions with flesh (the new Ripley is described as a &quot;meat
byproduct&quot;) and cloning (both Perlman and Pinon co-star in <i>City</i>). Jeunet tips
his hand early on, as the credit sequence examines the hideously disfigured first seven
attempts at Ripley through a distorted lens.</p>

<p>Ryder is just OK in a purposefully understated role, the principal attraction of which
is her inscrutable motivation, the revelation of which is a true surprise (although the
reason she's dogging Ripley can be guessed at but is never made entirely clear). Perlman
and Pinon make the greatest impact among the resolutely grotesque supporting players,
although Freeman is a convincing menace, Dourif goes pleasingly over the top in two scenes
that seem custom made for his brand of beetle-browed weirdness and Hedaya is a
tightly-wrapped menace who is missed when his inevitable end comes all too soon in the
picture. </p>

<p>Definite minuses include the inevitable claustrophobia of the environments necessary
for these stories (&quot;a lot of running down corridors,&quot; Ryder calls it) as well as
John C. Frizzell's colorless score.</p>

<p>In the end, <i>Alien Resurrection</i> works both as a stand-alone action extravaganza
with strong nods to other genre faves including <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i> and <i>Day
of the Dead</i>, and as a continuation of perhaps the strongest female character in
contemporary cinema. &quot;What happens now?&quot; Call asks, in a final grace note that
gives nothing away in the enjoyment of the film. &quot;I don't know,&quot; answers Ellen
Ripley the survivor, irrevocably changed but somehow wiser and certainly stronger for her
ordeal &#150; which may not yet be over, &quot;I'm a stranger here myself.&quot; Such a
weary redemption is indeed all one could hope for.</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Alien Resurrection</i> is even more fun (is that really the word for it?) if you've
ingested the first three installments on your home media of choice as a kind of appetizer
before the main course. Nothing less than a mirror of the decades in which they were made
(innocence gives way to braggadocio, then despair and cynical acceptance), the trilogy is
an interlocking triumph of planning and forethought. No time? Here's a brief gloss on
each, sort of a Ripley redux:</p>
<i>

<h2><a name="Alien" target="_top"></a>Alien</i> (1979)</h2>

<p>Ridley Scott's surprising, smoke-filled scare fest is the <i>Old Dark House</i> of
space movies &#150; more horror than sci-fi, really &#150; in which big-haired Weaver
(billed just below Tom Skerritt's doomed Captain Dallas) first battles the &quot;perfect
organism&quot; that methodically picks off everyone on the earth-bound mineral tanker <i>Nostromo</i>
after bursting through John Hurt's chest (Veronica Cartwright's split-second reaction of
sheer terror was achieved by springing the now-legendary special effect on the clueless
actors). The seeds of then-Chief Warrant Officer Ripley's series-long mistrust of
treacherous androids is planted when the synthetic Ash (Ian Holm) disobeys her direct
order and perhaps unwittingly allows the beast on board, the all-encompassing twin themes
of imperialism and greed via the <i>Nostromo's</i> pre-programmed orders to investigate
potential mining (colonization?) opportunities and Ash's recognition that the things might
actually have some biological (read: monetary) value. H.R. Giger's Lovecraftian designs
remain unsettlingly memorable today, as does the eerie beauty of Jerry Goldsmith's languid
score. &quot;What are my chances?&quot; Ripley types in to the computer mainframe, dubbed
&quot;Mother&quot; (the <i>Auriga</i>'s is called &quot;Father&quot;). &quot;Does not
compute,&quot; the machine replies with ominous serenity. &quot;Crew expendable.&quot;
&quot;You bitch!&quot; Ripley calls it later, prefiguring one of the more enduring motifs
of the whole series. And how's this for verisimilitude? <i>Alien</i> was filmed at Bray
Studios, the same British soundstages that hosed the classic Hammer horror films.</p>
<i>

<h2><a name="Alien2" target="_top"></a>Aliens</i> (1986)</h2>

<p>Helpless shock gives way to swaggering optimism in director James Cameron's titanic,
gizmo-crazed sequel, which devotes over two hours to the medium-haired Ripley's reluctant
return to the now-colonized LV 426 &#150; planet of the eggs &#150; 57 years after the
events of <i>Alien</i>, the reluctant adviser to a cocksure group of starship troopers
(complete with cute chick pilot) on a &quot;bug hunt&quot; that goes horribly awry.
Skeptical of her story (the vaporized M-Class freighter <i>Nostromo</i> was apparently
worth some $42 million &quot;adjusted&quot; dollars &#150; less than a quarter of the cost
of Cameron's upcoming movie) the centralized Company offers her a reinstatement of flight
status in the form of corporate weasel chaperone Burke (Paul Reiser doing a prototype Paul
Buckman), whose nefarious scheme to smuggle the alien through galactic customs attached to
Ripley's face prefigures the cryotube piracy of <i>Alien Resurrection</i>. Our heroine's
also saddled with another creepy android, Bishop (Lance Henriksen), who prefers the term
&quot;artificial person&quot; and turns out to be OK &#150; for the moment. Maybe the most
Freudian film of the bunch, as Ripley protects the resourceful young lone survivor Rebecca
&quot;Newt&quot; Jordan (Carrie Henn), flirts over heavy weaponry with Corporal Dwayne
Hicks (Michael Biehn) and squares off against the Queen for the first time in the bowels
of the massive Atmosphere Processor. <i>Aliens</i> marks the series debut of Alien Effects
Designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, who built beasts for all subsequent films
(&quot;Tom in fact is often the guy in the suit,&quot; Weaver told an interviewer
recently), while James Horner's memorable score is a clangy, militaristic industrial
symphony. </p>
<i>

<h2><a name="Alien3" target="_top"></a>Alien3</i> (1992)</h2>

<p>Ripley is engulfed by darkness and despair in director David Fincher's claustrophobic
and underrated big-screen debut (which looks a lot better in light of <a href="rseven.html" target="_top"><i>Seven</i></a> &#150; photographed by <i>Alien Resurrection</i>
cinematographer Darius Khondji &#150; and <i>The Game</i>), as she crash lands on Fiorina
&quot;Fury&quot; 161, a remote, nearly deserted, Class C Prison, maximum security, Double
Y Chromosome-Work Correctional Facility after drifting in space &#150; again &#150; for an
unspecified time. Shorn of her hair, Ripley is grief-stricken over the loss of Newt and
Hicks (&quot;they have been released from all darkness and pain,&quot; says Warden Andrews
[Brian Glover] almost wistfully) but manages to salvage enough of Bishop to verify what's
been killing the weaponless inmates of this bleak futuristic big house, all of whom appear
to be British &#150; one of them sings a snatch of the 1969 Zager &amp; Evans chestnut,
&quot;In the Year 2525 (Exordium &amp; Terminus)&quot;, before being ground into chow.
&quot;Do you have any faith, sister?&quot; asks the lone Yank, Dillon (Charles S. Dutton).
&quot;Not much,&quot; says Ripley, who promptly loses the only lover she's had during the
entire ordeal (Charles Dance's unexpectedly tender and dignified Clemens &#150; clemency?)
to the marauding alien. High points include the implanted Ripley's recitation of the line
&quot;somebody's got to kill me&quot; directly into the camera and the most genuinely
unsettling finale of the series &#150; an unrelentingly tragic denouement (featuring
Bishop's return, sort of) which is redeemed spectacularly by the principal plot twist of <i>Alien
Resurrection</i>.&nbsp;</p>
