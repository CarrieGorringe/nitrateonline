<p><big><strong><big>M</big></strong>ovies produced during the period of Hollywood's
so-called Golden Age, roughly those years between 1930 and 1945 when the dream machine was
at the glamorous peak of imagination and efficiency, provide unique and distinct pleasures
when viewed today. Deliberately paced and concerned more often than not with character
over circumstance, these films endure precisely because of their careful craftsmanship and
attention to detail at every level; remember, the studio system of old was for all intents
and purposes an assembly line (that's why these movies are so visually absorbing on
electronic screens far smaller than the medium for which they were made). </big></p>

<p>While perhaps not a film for the ages (percentage-wise, very few of the studio's
efforts are either), <i>John Grisham's The Rainmaker</i> yields many of those same
pleasures and marks yet another chapter in the extraordinary career of director Francis
Ford Coppola. Elegant, deliberate, and more than a bit mischievous (glamorous it's not),
the movie is very much like the image projected by the filmmaker himself. Like-minded
audiences in should gravitate to the film in large numbers as a rewarding alternative to
louder, flashier and more superficial holiday fare.</p>

<p>Honest and self-deprecating, young law school grad Rudy Baylor (Damon) aspires to not
only do good in his much-maligned profession but be a &quot;rainmaker&quot; as well,
seeking out clients with potentially lucrative legal beefs to enrich his status in
whichever firm has the foresight to retain him. For the moment, however, Rudy is tooling
around Memphis with his possessions lashed to the roof of his car (he's been evicted),
tracking down leads in partnership with cheerful ambulance chaser Deck Shifflet (DeVito)
for shady boss J. Lyman &quot;Bruiser&quot; Stone (Mickey Rourke).</p>

<p><img src="images/rrainmaker-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="144">Rudy's three
seemingly unrelated current cases include the murky estate of timorous but tart senior
citizen Miss Birdie (Wright), the plight of young battered wife Kelly Riker (Danes) and
the medical dilemma of leukemia patient Donny Ray Black (Whitworth), whose experimental
treatment is refused by the Great Benefit Insurance company despite the dogged
letter-writing efforts of his mother Dot (Mary Kay Place) and to the silent, alcoholic
despair of his father Buddy (Red West). &quot;There's nothing more thrilling than nailing
and insurance company,&quot; says Deck wistfully, perhaps envious that Rudy nails the bar
exam on his first try (Shifflet's failed six times to date). Deciding that they could do
better on their own, the young and earnest attorney joins forces with the cynical
&quot;paralawyer&quot; in their own threadbare firm.</p>

<p>As Rudy works his way earnestly through the first two cases, the third begins to take
on David and Goliath proportions, with Baylor cast as the latter doing courtroom battle
with legal heavyweight Leo F. Drummond (Voight) and his phalanx of smooth associates under
the benevolent but watchful eye of Judge Tyrone Kipler (Danny Glover, uncredited).</p>

<p><img src="images/rrainmaker-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="144">While the
outcome of these three story strands are rarely in doubt, the movie envelops the audience
in a faded, seedy, contemporary Memphis milieu that is persuasively daunting yet oddly
benevolent. And far from &quot;just another shark in dirty water,&quot; as the clever
credit gag and bouncy yet hard-boiled narration (penned by Michael Herr, who did similar
duty on Coppola's <i>Apocalypse Now</i>) would have you believe of the much-maligned legal
profession, the autobiographical tone of Grisham's book &#150; part memoir, perhaps?
&#150; has been preserved and enhanced by Coppola's clever direction. With natural, almost
bumbling movement taking place in dilapidated houses, cluttered yards and dark courtrooms,
the movie presents a good vs. evil story that casts the ongoing debates of health care,
punitive damages, spousal abuse and other hot-button societal issues in a very human
light. This is perhaps the least flamboyant and most plausible courtroom drama ever made.</p>

<p>It isn't difficult to see what attracted Coppola to this material. Like Orson Welles
before him, who according to one of many legends mollified an insistent producer while on
an airport pay phone by yelling out the first title he could make out from the paperback
rack at the adjacent newsstand (that's how <i>Touch of Evil</i> got made), Coppola
recently revealed to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that he picked up &quot;The
Rainmaker&quot; on a whim while boarding a flight to Paris because &quot;I thought it
would be fun to read a best-selling book... Maybe I could learn what the public
wants.&quot; At the same time, the idealistic and easygoing character of Rudy Baylor
must've appealed to Coppola's strong streaks of fair play and endurance &#150; traits that
have served the filmmaker well during a career of extremes stretching from the
phenomenally successful <i>Godfather</i> films to the sweet but sadly underrated 1996
Robin Williams vehicle <i>Jack</i> (itself a property given unexpected autobiographical
resonance by the ever young-thinking director).</p>

<p>While certainly no <i>Touch of Evil</i>, <i>John Grisham's The Rainmaker</i> is a
sensible, moderate entertainment &#150; arguably just what a certain disenfranchised
segment of the movie-going public (read: older audience) is looking for (one quick note on
the ungainly title: with this, the sixth movie adapted from his novels, the author ascends
to a rarified but not necessarily quality-guaranteed possessory credit stratosphere that
includes Jacqueline Susann and Stephen King).</p>

<p>As befits the source material and repertory tone, the acting is distinctive without
being overly showy. Voight and Glover give perhaps the most memorable performances, in
roles that invite idiosyncratic flourishes &#150; a wave of the arm<img src="images/rrainmaker-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="144">, an arch of the
eyebrow &#150; without the kind of distracting showboating that has dogged both careers
(they've never been bad, exactly, just kind of annoying). The film's most resonant tribute
to old-style Hollywood comes in the form of Teresa Wright (<i>Mrs. Miniver</i>, <i>Pride
of the Yankees,</i> <i>Shadow of a Doubt</i>, <i>The Men</i>, <i>The Best Years of Our
Lives</i>), who brings a feisty dignity to the role of Miss Birdie after a big-screen
layoff of almost a decade (she was in <i>The Good Mother</i>). Damon makes an interesting
lead in the sincere tradition of Mickey Rooney or a very young Jimmy Stewart with a role
that is by nature reactive instead of active, while Danes brings a tremulous quality to
her portrayal of a battered wife who finds a perhaps unexpected inner strength. Coppola's
skill as a director comes to the fore with his coaching of secondary performances from a
cast as distinctive as sitcom veteran Mary Kay Place and Dean Stockwell, as iffy as Roy
Scheider (great as the spacey, almost creepy CEO of Great Benefit) and as green as Johnny
Whitworth and country superstar Randy Travis (in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him turn as a
juror).</p>

<p>Always a proponent of meticulous production design, logical pacing and distinctive
cinematography, Coppola has enlisted designer Howard Cummings (<i>The Usual Suspects</i>),
regular cutter Barry Malkin (<i>The Godfather Part III</i>, <i>Jack</i>), <img src="images/rrainmaker-4.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="144">and back-to-back Oscar
winning photographer John Toll (<i>Legends of the Fall</i>, <i>Braveheart</i>) to give the
film a distinctive, real-life personality that culminates spectacularly in the climactic
courtroom sequences. Unlike many of the other actual locations, this atmospheric space was
constructed in an unused airplane hangar at the about-to-be-decommissioned Alameda Naval
Air Station across the bay from San Francisco. &quot;It's very hard to re-invent the
courtroom but Francis really wanted to,&quot; remembers Cummings in the press material for
the film. &quot;It's a civil not a criminal case, although in our civil case there is a
life and death struggle. But the basics of the law are being addressed and I felt that
austerity would be more unusual at this point than what we've seen so far, and with this
kind of [wide-screen] framing, you can really explore something like that.&quot; The
gambit works, as the sequences have all the tension but none of the pretensions found in
most courtroom scenes; the space is as much a star of the picture as any of the actors.</p>

<p>A jaded movie-going companion at a recent public screening of <i>John Grisham's The
Rainmaker</i> defended her purchase of cellophane-swathed bonbons by insisting she'd only
unwrap them &quot;during the explosions.&quot; Imagine her surprise &#150; and yours
&#150; when the movie reveals itself as concerned more with human interaction than random
detonation. Credit Coppola's astute elevation of an airplane read (shades of <i>The
Godfather</i>!) to his graceful worldview and commitment to emotional quality. The
filmmaker should be entering his own Golden Age just about now, and if we're all very
lucky the success of this well-tooled enterprise will allow him to pursue the projects
that have in the past resulted in his bravest and most thrilling work.</p>
