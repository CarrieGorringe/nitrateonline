<p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="4">ndependence Day is the 800-pound
gorilla of the summer action-filmfest; in less than seven days after its US opening, <em>ID4</em>
pulled in $100m and is closing fast on a $300m box-office total to date. As might be
expected, a sequel is already in the planning stages, perhaps for 1998, and other
imitations are likely to follow. Pundits in the entertainment industry are falling all
over themselves to find an explanation for the film's popularity. Perhaps the best
explanation for the success of <em>ID4</em> is the most simple: it may not be much for the
mind, but it most certainly -- alone of all its brethren this summer -- has a great deal
of heart. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If you've seen the trailer for <em>ID4</em>, you already know that the
film is concerned with that good old standby known as the invasion of the little green men
on the second of July. Except that these men are neither little, nor green (and I wouldn't
bet the house on their gender, either), and cruise in with spaceships the size of football
fields. They are, however, exceedingly nasty. Without attempts at negotiation or prior
warning, they begin to settle over major American cities and blow them up. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Being a noble sort at heart, the young and insecure American president,
Thomas J. Whitmore (Pullman), tries to prevent everyone from coming apart at the seams.
Meanwhile, back in New York, a satellite expert named David Levinson (Goldblum) is able to
decipher the intervessel code that the mothership is emitting, and discovers that the
aliens are up to - what else? - no good. So he races with his obnoxious father (Hirsch) to
Washington, where he presents his findings to the President's chief-of-staff, Constance
Spano (Colin), who also happens to be Levinson's rather bitter ex-wife. </font></p>

<p>The President doesn't like Levinson either, but, after several cities have been
barbecued, everyone is willing to listen. All armed forces are placed on alert and one
cocky Air Force pilot based in California, Steven Hiller (Smith), vows to &quot;kick ET's
butt&quot;. Of course, conventional weapons don't work, the President's wife (McDonnell)
is in peril, and there's a drunken ex-pilot (Quaid) who is trying to redeem himself for
good measure. Throw in some conspiracy-theory stuff about the 1947 sightings of UFOs in
Roswell, not to mention the top-secret Air Force base in Nevada known as Area 51, and you
have the basic ingredients of <em>ID4</em>. </p>

<p>It could take a while to explain the various cinematic borrowings employed in the plot
of <em>ID4</em>, as they encompass a couple of genres and at least that many decades.
There's a rather blatant example of theft from <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>, and every other
good or bad sci-fi film from the '50s that you can remember (among them, <em>The Day the
Earth Stood Still</em> and <em>Invaders from Mars</em>). The narrative trajectory of <em>ID4</em>,
steeped in this paranoiac sensibility, comes straight from the 1953 George Pal version of <em>War
of the Worlds</em> (except for the fact that Earth will not find salvation this time in
the arms of a heaven-sent plague), and is seasoned with a strong overlay of motifs from
disaster films of the '70s. </p>

<p>But this unabashed pastiche is not an insult to your intelligence; co-writers Emmerich
and Devlin (the team behind the popular-but-vapid <em>Stargate</em> of two years earlier)
borrow in a way that is witty and knowing, giving just the right amount of irreverent, yet
respectful, tweaking to each element. Underneath it all is a strong sense of old-fashioned
patriotism and faith in the system that would not be out of place in a Capra film.
Moreover, there's a sincerity in the application of those elements that goes deeper than
the surface. <em>ID4</em>, like the best of Capra's work, does not deny that there are
problems, but they can all be worked out if we just believe in ourselves and the elemental
goodness and rectitude of 'the American way' and work together to keep the system on
track. </p>

<p>This theme is seldom made a central part of American films these days, primarily
because so doing can render a filmmaker open to the accusation of harboring some sort of
conservative wish-fulfillment tendencies. There is no doubt that Capraesque themes can be
maudlin and woefully inaccurate. Do such themes make a film any less relevant? Judging
from the reactions I heard at a screening of <em>ID4</em>, the answer had to be a
resounding &quot;no&quot;. There was a real hunger in the audience for what this film had
to offer. Cheers accompanied each new victory against the aliens, while audible gasps of
pain and disbelief were heard in the audience at the sight of the Statue of Liberty lying,
broken and battered, partially submerged after an attack. </p>

<p>Even after making allowances for the jingoistic strains that can exist in certain
quarters of American patriotism, it still seemed as if people who had not cheered for
anything in years were sloughing off their cynicism, taking this film and running with it.
<em>ID4</em> could easily fall prey to the accusation of being nothing more than a
pathetic postmodern attempt to offer up something different to its audience. If it were
simply a warmed-over offering of what has come before, then special effects alone would
not have been enough to keep the film afloat for over two hours. </p>

<p>Additionally, <em>ID4</em> is not an advocate for a return to social repression, or, as
many academic journals will no doubt depict it, a covert expression of xenophobia, but it
does emphasize, in its borrowing from other eras, the need that humans seem to have for
mythologies and symbols representing higher objectives than those found in everyday life. </p>

<p>The film's objective - in entertaining the audience, not in averting the alien threat -
is ably assisted by performances that give the audience something to cheer for. Goldblum's
work as a loopy satellite specialist is paramount and Will Smith is also most engaging and
effective. It's no coincidence that when the two come together to perform that vital task
that conquers the Martians (or whatever they are), both of them make the film shine. </p>

<p>Pullman's president is somewhat ill-defined for the first half of the film, but the
actor warms to the role of hero just in time to save the day (and his role's credibility).
Quaid's performance also must be singled out for his touching rendition of a washed-up
individual who pulls together what's left of the ragged ends of his life for one last shot
at redemption. As Smith's stripper girlfriend who is also, in her own way, looking for
redemption, Fox proves to be a dignified and resourceful woman, providing strong evidence
that the distaff side of the martial balance sheet is not without representation. </p>

<p>Loggia is appropriately gruff and sensible as the President's military adviser. In a
too-brief cameo, Spiner (Data of <i>Star Trek: TNG</i>) is absolutely side-splitting as a
scientist who has obviously been sniffing too much formaldehyde in his role of putting
your tax dollars to work (look also for cameos by Harry Connick Jr and Harvey Fierstein,
although the latter isn't all that inspiring and could even be defined as downright
offensive in certain quarters). The only sour note during the proceedings is the
stereotypical rendition of the Jewish father-as-yenta from Hirsch; it's the one borrowing
from the cinematic past that isn't very effective or very funny, and Hirsch doesn't do
much except to accentuate its worst tendencies (in the actor's defense, there's not much
that can be done with it). Someone should have stuffed a fresh, chewy bagel into his mouth
during reel two, while screaming, &quot;Enough, already!&quot; and then we all could have
had some peace while the aliens tried to blow everything up. </p>

<p><em>ID4</em> is not without its problems. The film would have benefited from a more
judicious use of the scissors at certain points (at two hours and forty-five minutes in
length, the first two-thirds of the film are paced somewhat slowly), but the film's finale
is worth the wait. At a cost of seventy million dollars, <em>ID4</em> has also had to make
a few adjustments, using matte paintings in lieu of computer-generated effects (perhaps
part of its homage to the past?) and very occasionally the difference is noticeable, but
the filmmakers have shrewdly placed those visually-awkward moments near the film's end,
when any potentially negative side effects are minimized. If you can tolerate the
pastiche-styled construction, if you enjoy a game of 'Spot the Movie Reference', or if you
want to see a good-old-fashioned film, <em>ID4</em> is just the ticket.</p>
