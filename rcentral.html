<p><big><strong><big>W</big></strong>hen this subtly magnificent new movie from Brazil won
the coveted Golden Bear award for best film at the 1998 Berlin International Film
Festival, many saw the unexpected yet welcomed honor as a continued validation of a more
accessible and financially responsible cinema being pioneered for the global marketplace
by filmmakers who understand the fundamentals of simple yet elegant dramatic structure and
the universality of human emotion. <i>Central Station</i> is performed in the native
Portuguese of director Walter Salles, yet its human feelings and command of filmmaking
render it a work capable of speaking to audiences in all corners of the earth.</big></p>

<p>In the bustling train terminal of downtown Rio de Janeiro, 67-year-old desultory
ex-teacher Dora (Fernanda Montenegro) works writing brief letters for those wishing to
contact loved ones. In the evening she spreads them out on the table of her cramped
apartment, deciding with single neighbor Irene (Marilia Pera) which will be thrown away
and which will be stuffed into a drawer and eventually mailed -- maybe. Taking
uncharacteristic pity on recently orphaned 10-year-old Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira), Dora
corrects an disasterous initial decision regarding the boy&#146;s welfare and accompanies
him on an ardous journey to the remote Northeast section of Brazil in search of the father
Josue&#146;s never met and perhaps an elusive peace of her own.</p>

<p>The same age as her character, Fernanda Montenegro (&quot;our own Gena Rowlands or
Giulietta Masina,&quot; Salles told one interviewer) hasn&#146;t made a lot of films,
preferring to work in theater pieces that inevitably become so successful -- her acclaimed
performance in Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#146;s &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra Von
Kant&quot; lasted for three years -- that they prevent her from taking more movie roles.
Nevertheless, she found time for Leon Hirszman&#146;s <i>They Don&#146;t Wear Black Tie</i>,
which won the Golden Lion at the 1980 Venice Film Festival, and she&#146;s won the best
actress award from festivals in Moscow (for Paulo Porto&#146;s <i>Em</i> <i>Familia</i> in
1970), Taormina, Italy (for Arnaldo Jabor&#146;s <i>Tudo Bem</i> in 1977) and Berlin (for <i>Central
Station</i>). By turns tough and tender, she brings to Dora a world-weariness made fresh
by the sheer tenaciousness of the character; in such scenes as her harrowing rescue of
Josue from some unscrupulous types, she seems not at all in control of the valiant side of
her nature, and this crusading impulsiveness is both enthralling and endearing. </p>

<p>As integral a part of Brazilian culture as Montenegro has become, the opposite is true
of young Vinicius de Oliveira, whom Salles and Cohn discovered shining shoes in the Rio de
Janeiro airport and chose over some 1500 hopefuls for the part of Josue. Nearly 10 at the
time, he&#146;d never been to the movies but, said Salles, &quot;was a street kid that had
the knowledge of what the street means and the difficulties of fighting for survival. But
he had not lost his innocence in going through that phase.&quot; If this is starting to
sound familiar, remember Hector Babenco&#146;s notorioius 1981 Brazilian film <i>Pixote</i>
(whose young star was subsequently murdered), which told a much more violent and explicit
story of survival on the tough streets -- and also starred Marilia Pera (Irene) as a
troubled prostitute. </p>

<p>The film&#146;s award-winning script was developed at the Sundance Institute, after
Salles turned over the basic idea to the two young screenwriters. A filmmaker possessed of
an uncommonly clear-eyed passion for urgent social issues and seductive production values,
he first came to international attention when he segued from documentaries to the
provocative <i>Foreign Land</i> (it, too, was photographed by Walter Carvalho, who, in the
kinetic, widescreen images of <i>Central Station</i> somehow manages to make Rio and the
desolate Northeast section of Brazil simultaneously gritty and slick). The 1995 film sets
its story of international intrigue against the ripple effect caused by the disasterous
policies of since-impeached president Fernando Collor at the turn of the decade. Since
completing <i>Central Station</i>, Salles has partnered again with Daniela Thomas
(co-director of <i>Foreign Land</i>) on <i>Midnight</i> (<i>Mia</i> <i>Noche</i>), a
75-minute French co-production developed as part of the &quot;2000 Seen By&#133;&quot;
series for the French TV station Arte.</p>

<p>In Swiss-born producer Arthur Cohn, Salles seems to have found a soulmate with a
superlative international reputation. No less than five of his productions have earned
Oscars (a record), including <i>The Sky Above, the Mud Below</i> (Best Documentary
Feature, 1963),<i> The Garden of the Finzi-Continis </i>(Best Foreign Language Film,
1963), <i>Black and White in Color</i> (Best Foreign Language Film, 1978), <i>Dangerous</i>
<i>Moves</i> (Best Foreign Language Film, 1985) and <i>American</i> <i>Dream</i> (Best
Documentary Feature, 1991). If these and the other films he&#146;s produced have anything
in common, it is a vigourous but often melancholy concern for dignity in the face of
social injustice as well as the quest for freedom from helplessness and the redemption
that can come from making and executing hard choices.</p>

<p>As Oscar time approaches, <i>Central</i> <i>Station</i> looms as a film with the power
to join that short list of movies nominated in the general categories (<i>Il Postino</i>
is the most obvious recent example). Industry reports link Cohn and Salles to a new
project to be filmed in Santa Fe, New Mexico; no matter how their new partnership plays
out, it has already produced one great movie that will be embraced by audiences all over
the world. </p>
