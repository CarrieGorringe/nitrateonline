<meta name="description" content="Zero Effect - Another in a string of dreary January releases, this title could be about the discovery of Chicago deep-dish pizza, but is actually about good guys vs. bad guys vs. sea monster. Deep Rising makes a valiant attempt to become the South China Seas' answer to the Bermuda Triangle, but off-the-shelf acting and a hackneyed plot won't keep this oversized barge afloat. Maybe all the people who have seen Titanic ten times will want to give this film their attention, but any comparisons are bound to be disappointing. Even the creature designed by Rob Bottin (noted for his work on Total Recall and Robocop) reminds me of giant phlegm. How enticing!">

<p><big><strong><big>F</big></strong>inally, something to write home about! This hip blend
of Sherlock Holmes and Howard Hughes is an offbeat suspense comedy featuring Bill Pullman
(presidential timber in <a href="rid4.html" target="_top"><i>Independence Day</i></a>) as Daryl Zero,
the self-proclaimed &quot;world's most private detective&quot; and his sidekick,
straight-laced Steve Arlo (Ben Stiller, who co-starred in <i>Flirting With Disaster</i>,
one of the best-written films of 1996).</big></p>

<p>Lawrence Kasdan was a few years over 30 when he directed and wrote <i>Body Heat </i>(1981).
At 22, son Jake has helmed and scripted a premiere effort, small and sweet, melting like
an M&amp;M in your mouth. I giggled a lot as I watched this film, much the same way the
character portrayed by James Earl Jones chuckled as he ventured off into the cornfield in <i>Field
of Dreams</i>. Little touches add to the lunacy. Like an absurdly stocked kitchen
featuring a refrigerator filled with cans of Tab, stainless steel shelves piled high with
cans of Campbell Soup and Bumble Bee Tuna, plastic spoons, and a bulk bag of pretzels. Or
an alarm code longer than the number of letters in Mississippi. This is the home of
reclusive Daryl Zero, a social misfit who pens awful songs (&quot;Let's Run Off and Get
Married&quot;), actually written by Pullman and Kasdan, probably after polishing off a
six-pack and commiserating over a friendship that has fostered since Kasdan fils met
Pullman on the set of The Accidental Tourist ten years ago.</p>

<p>Zero is definitely lacking in the social graces when not on a case, and he has solved
some of the world's most stultifying mysteries, including The Case Of The Man With
Mismatched Shoelaces and The Case of the Hired Gun Who Made Too Many Mistakes (an
obviously skewered nod to the episode names used in the old Perry Mason television
series). Throughout the film, he hacks away on his computer screen, documenting his many
successes, since his black-attired (suit, shirt, and tie) assistant/crutch Arlo prefers
not to take on the scribblings that Dr. Watson would willingly accept. Arlo is the front
man/go-between, a smooth-tongued former attorney who scouts out potential clients,
while privately expounding at a local watering hole the frustration he feels with his
eccentric employer. His current customer is wealthy Portland tycoon Gregory Stark (Ryan
O'Neal, in a wonderfully drawn performance), who wants Zero to find some lost keys. Yeah,
lost keys, and they've been missing for a year. Zero, intrigued by Stark's reluctance to
discuss particulars in the matter, shuffles off his agoraphobic chains and heads to Oregon
in the disguise of Nick Carmine, an L.A. accountant. He finds a lot more than just Gregory
Stark's lost keys. The world's greatest observer finds, and eventually falls for, Gloria
Sullivan (Kim Dickens), a seemingly straight-arrow paramedic whose growing involvement in the case is shown from Zero's distanced point-of-view,
often in slow motion recollections.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;I always say the essence of my work relies fundamentally on two basic principles:
  Objectivity and Observation, or 'The Two Obs' as I call them.&quot; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#150; Daryl Zero</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These little bon mots are sprinkled throughout the film, often with deadpan delivery.
Devilishly divine homilies that make you smile. &quot;Sometimes what you're looking for is
right in front of your nose.&quot; Stiller gets his share of zingers, too. In one scene
with O'Neal at a playground, Arlo is pushing the swing of a little girl as Stark
approaches. As the child leaves, Stark asks if she's his kid. &quot;No, she's a
rental.&quot; McGuffins are there too.</p>

<p>A snappy musical score by The Greyboy Allstars and well-placed camerawork by Bill Pope
add to the fun. In one scene with Arlo and Stark at a nearly deserted restaurant in
subdued afternoon light, the camera tracks up, sideways, and in from the floor. Odd
angles, but, of course, it is an odd film. </p>

<p>The movie grabs you in and doesn't let you go till two hours later. Of course, Zero
solves the mystery. Was there any doubt? I wager not everyone will enjoy this film as much
as I have (and I've seen it twice). Let it grow on you. Like a fine wine. Kick off your
shoes (well maybe not in the theater), sit back, relax, and enjoy. Welcome to the wacky
world of Daryl Zero.</p>
