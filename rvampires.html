<p><big><strong><big>F</big></strong>or a moment it looked like Carpenter was on a
comeback. After a series of critical and financial flops he returned to his lean, mean
roots of action and horror in a Howard Hawks vein, a horror western about vampire
exterminators in the southwest. Despite mixed reviews Carpenter&#146;s violent exercise in
undead mayhem (sort of a &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; take on the vampire High command) became
the number one film on Halloween weekend and his biggest opening in years, but then
slipped off the top ten in two weeks. It&#146;s not too surprising. Aesthetic judgments
aside, Carpenter is happily out of step with contemporary Hollywood. His iconoclastic
vision is simply too idiosyncratic for the popcorn munching genre audiences and too
gleefully macho for the art film crowd. </big></p>

<p>The film kicks off with an bloody attack by team Crow, the Vatican sponsored group led
by the foul-mouthed black hat hero Jack Crow (James Woods), on a vampire nest. In
Carpenter&#146;s world, vampire hunting isn&#146;t something for dandified Victorian
gentlemen in foggy graveyards but more of a SWAT operation, the team armed with automatic
weapons (that&#146;s just to get their attention), metal stakes, and harpoon guns.
He&#146;s also streamlined the vampire lore &#150; the only thing that&#146;ll kill these
bloodsuckers is a stake through the heart and sunlight. So the team falls into a rhythm:
harpoon a bloodsucker, kick in the winch and drag him into the sunlight, where he/she
explodes in a white-hot flame. But the raid is only a partial success because the Master
vampire is nowhere to be seen. </p>

<p><img src="images/rvampires-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">As Crow&#146;s
Vatican sponsored team celebrates victory with hookers and booze that night, retribution
visits in the form of Valek (6&#146;5&quot; Thomas Ian Griffith looking like the lead
singer of a goth band in his long leather coat), the powerful vampire master who slices
and dices partygoers with his Ginsu fingernails, but not before he bites prostitute
Katrina (Sheryl Lee) in one of the most outrageously sexually suggestive scenes to get by
in an R film. Crow and his sole surviving team member Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) grab
Katrina, whose fresh blood ties have established a psychic link to Valek, and get the hell
out of Dodge to regroup. Team Crow inherits a rookie priest, Father Adam (a fresh faced
Tim Guinee), a green, uninitiated kid who worships Crow and ultimately who provides clues
to Valek&#146;s master plan (after a little persuasion by the contemptuous Crow). Montoya
holes up with Katrina, his feelings starting to melt as he watches Katrina slowly turn to
the darkside (not a particularly believable romance but handled in the tough, taciturn
style that makes for good pulp fiction). Finally the new team plans its attack.</p>

<p>Carpenter turns John Steakley&#146;s novel &quot;Vampire$&quot; into a perverse remake
of Howard Hawks&#146; &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; by way of Sergio Leone and &quot;The Wild
Bunch.&quot; James Woods is a foul mouthed, hard drinking, whore-mongering John Wayne
leading a grimy pack of vampire hunting professionals. It&#146;s machismo run amuck and
Carpenter loves it, but his unrepentant misogynist macho warriors are sure to offend
audiences not already turned off by the gory bloodshed. Once Katrina is turned she becomes
something less than an animal in Crow&#146;s eyes; she&#146;s tied up, pushed, prodded,
and at one point wakes up tied naked and spread-eagled on a bed &#150; Mr. Sensitivity
Jack Crow ain&#146;t. There&#146;s a perverse comic book irony in such extreme characters
as emissaries of the Vatican, with Woods playing Jack Crow with the glee of a choir boy
gone bad &#150; he&#146;s been raised by Catholic church but he&#146;s not above beating
the shit out of a priest to get information. It&#146;s the kind of conundrum that exists
only in the movies and Carpenter plays it for all it&#146;s worth. </p>

<p>As he sweeps away the familiar vampire lore (garlic, crucifixes, running water,
etc&#133;), Carpenter ties the vampires even more directly to the Christian church and
it&#146;s iconography. It&#146;s a nice symmetry: just as Lucifer is a fallen angel, so
the first vampire Valek is a fallen priest, transformed by the church itself in a
forbidden ritual gone wrong to holy hell. The southwest architecture, with gothic arches
and old world ambiance, echoes the site of the crime centuries ago. By the time Crow is
tied to the cross for crucifixion you&#146;ll either be cheering or jeering Carpenter for
his audacity.</p>

<p><img src="images/rvampires-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">It&#146;s not
Carpenter&#146;s best film, and audiences have already proven it&#146;s far from his most
popular, but in this period when political correctness is battled only by juvenilia and
bad taste comedies, there&#146;s something perversely satisfying in the rampant sexism,
violence, and machismo run amuck. I share one significant touchstone with Carpenter: a
love of all things Howard Hawks, which perhaps makes me more susceptible to his moral
world. From the Father Adam&#146;s baptism of blood and fire (he finds he has a flair for
the exhilarating work) which earns his place in the group, to the hokey tough-guy farewell
at the conclusion of the film as two warriors express their love for another in body
language and terse oaths before turning their backs on one another, destined to become
nemeses, I love these decades-old conventions brought into the present. </p>

<p>The film slows for an exposition heavy second act, where each of the characters
(including guest Cardinal Maximillian Schell, as the religious authority overseeing the
vampire hunting teams) opens up with personal histories and historical background, but
it&#146;s a forgivable misstep. The problems with audiences seem more tied to Woods&#146;
verbal diarrhea (&quot;So tell me,&quot; he asks Father Adam, &quot;when I was beating the
shit out you, did you get a little wood?&quot;), the team&#146;s unrepentant misogyny, and
the machismo so thick</p>

<p>the musk wafts off the screen. Too bad. From the blood red skies and dusky, dusty
landscapes (courtesy longtime cinematographer Gary Kibbe) to the Carpetner&#146;s Ry
Cooder-esque score (which switches from slide guitar to bluesy synthesizer soon after the
main titles) to the ferocious vampires which suggest both wild animals and European gothic
stateliness, Carpenter has married the western and the vampire film in an earthy epic
style. Carpenter&#146;s sleek, stark images and stripped down, no-holds-barred action is
pure pulp glory and an antidote to the formula genre pictures and special effects driven
vehicles that pass as action films nowadays. It&#146;s the most fun I&#146;ve had at the
movies for some time. </p>
