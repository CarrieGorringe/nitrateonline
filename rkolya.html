<p><font size="5"><strong>P</strong></font><font size="4">recisely a decade ago, Czech
director Jiri Menzel's whimsical rural comedy <i>My Sweet Little Village</i> (<i>Vesnicko
ma strediskova</i>) delighted art-house audiences in the United States and proudly
represented Czechoslovakia in the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Academy
Awards, losing to Fons Rademaker's Dutch drama <i>The Assault</i>. The ensuing years saw
much change in that part of the world: the Velvet Revolution freed Czechs and Slovaks from
Socialist rule, the country split apart in a purely political move that most citizens to
this day barely understand and strongly disagree with, and the film industry, once an
imaginative and mischievous contributor to world cinema, fell silent -- the victim, as in
many other nations, of economic upheaval and the invasion of Hollywood. </font></p>

<p>As evidenced by the charming and affecting new Czech film <i>Kolya</i>, in which a
fiftyish bachelor must deal with a five-year-old Russian boy and his own stale lifestyle
on the eve of the Velvet Revolution, the intervening ten years have seen one constant:
Zdenek Sverak. The writer and star of the film, an immensely popular presence on the Czech
cultural scene for nearly 30 years, is also the author of <i>My Sweet Little Village</i>
and the father of this new film's director, Jan Sverak (he's also an actor, seen in the
United States in Menzel's previously banned 1969 satire<i> Larks on a String</i>).
Together, they signal a new beginning for Czech cinema and represent a new breed of
hyphenate filmmaker that can work hand-in-hand with international co-producers and
aggressive distributors to present films about the foibles of individual countries to
audiences around the world.</p>

<p>Frantisek Louka (Sverak <i>pere</i>) is a confirmed bachelor in his mid-fifties who
lives in a top-floor garret flat near the Hradcany Castle in Old Town Prague. Fired from
the symphony orchestra (apparently for political reasons, although he seems to possess a
grumpy mischievousness that could easily be misinterpreted as subversive), he spends his
days in a desultory quartet playing the cello for funerals at the city crematorium and his
nights entertaining other men's wives -- when he can coax them away from their husbands.
His most recent conquest is Klara (Libuse Safrankova), who sings with the quartet at the
funerals. Franta seems to be always short of cash, and thus takes in odd jobs such as
replacing the gold trim on tombstones when he's not racing from cremation to cremation. </p>

<p>His gravedigger friend Mr. Broz (Ondrez Vetchy), whom he owes a great deal of money,
comes to him one day with a business proposal: a marriage of convenience to a distant
Russian niece who needs papers. Louka resists at first (like most Czechs, he views
Russians with discrete contempt) but relents when Nadezda (Irena Livanova) turns out to be
beautiful. As soon as they're married she promptly emigrates to West Germany and her
lover, leaving the responsibility for sheltering her five-year-old son Kolya -- a little
Russian, but a Russian nonetheless -- to Franta. Not only must Louka make room for Kolya
in his flat and his life, but he must manage an existence that, in 1988 Prague, includes
such annoying minutiae as taping Russian flags to his windows for holiday celebrations and
being hauled in for the occasional inept but nonetheless sinister interrogation. Each will
change the other's life in subtle but tangible ways, climaxing in the Velvet Revolution of
late 1989 (mixing documentary footage and a staged concert in the Old Town Square) and
their inevitable parting. Along the way, their life together unfolds with humor, pathos
enough sly and dark humor to mark this as a Czech film in the rich tradition of vintage
Milos Forman (the Oscar-nominated <i>Loves of a Blonde</i>, <i>Fireman's Ball</i>) and,
yes, <i>My Sweet Little Village</i>. </p>

<p><i>Kolya</i> is full of graceful, provocative imagery and metaphor, beginning with the
musical motif of Dvorak's theme for the 23rd Psalm (&quot;The Lord is My Shepherd, I Shall
Not Want...&quot;). It both opens the film and serves as a sublime coda, as the boy
recites the psalm -- in Czech! -- as he flies to Moscow at the end. An eagle is glimpsed
briefly as Franta drives from the city to the country, mirroring the reverence and
eagerness with which many Czechs view trips to the country. Perhaps the most fully
fleshed-out visual analogy of the film is the bauble that Louka finds as he cleans out the
gutters at his mother's house. Nobody seems to know whether it has value (he rejects a low
offer from a jeweler), and speculation varies wildly on how it could have ended up on a
roof. Young Kolya, too, is a treasure of indeterminate value, and there is puzzlement over
how he got where he is and what to do with him.</p>

<p>Jan Sverak draws a remarkable performance out of the young Andrej Chalimon as Kolya
that is the heart and soul of the film. Discovered in a Moscow kindergarten after five
visits and a desperate plea to the Russian casting company to look for &quot;the biggest
troublemakers&quot; (&quot;often the troublemakers have the biggest personalities,&quot;
Jan Sverak told the New<em> York Times</em>), young Chalimon takes to his new profession
well and is the emotional barometer by which the callous Franta can be gauged -- and
redeemed. &quot;I think that we need films about feeling and compassion,&quot; Zdenek
Sverak says in the film's American presskit. &quot;I liked the idea of a man who is under
all sorts of pressure and yet he listens to his heart. I should say that we need films on
this subject more than any other.&quot; </p>

<p>The attention to detail on the set bears mention as well. The Sveraks have remarked on
the challenge of &quot;dressing down&quot; Prague to insure that there were no
advertisements on walls or trams, and Zdenek Sverak tells the story of how Jan noticed
that his shoes were too clean for a Socialist era bachelor. The Trabant Louka buys is of
appropriate vintage, and even the Czech money dates from before the revolution. Who would
have thought only a decade ago that such effort would be involved to insure that the
official Czechoslovak crest on government buildings featured the Soviet star above the
lion instead of the now-restored crown?</p>

<p>As is usual with foreign films, many language-based in-jokes are lost on the
monolingual viewer. One of Kolya's early words in Czech is &quot;chemodan,&quot; which
means suitcase, and the wordplay between the boy and the man with the word
&quot;krasny&quot; springs from its dual meaning: &quot;red&quot; in Russian and
&quot;beautiful&quot; in Czech. The fun even extends to proper names, as the distracted
social worker that Franta has forgotten he summoned -- and no longer wants -- is named
&quot;Zubata,&quot; Czech slang for the grim reaper. </p>

<p>Born in 1965 and a filmmaker since his father gave him a Super-8 camera as a boy,
director Jan Sverak has made four features and numerous shorts. His 1989 student film <i>Oil
Gobblers</i> (<i>Ropaci</i>) won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Student Film, and his
debut feature Elementary School (<i>Obecna Skola</i>) -- also written by his father -- was
the last film to represent the united Czechoslovakia, in the Foreign Language Film
category of the 1991 Oscars (it lost to Italy's entry <i>Mediterraneo</i>). His second
feature, 1994's <i>Accumulator 1</i> (<i>Akumulator 1</i>) -- which co-stars his father --
is an imaginative, tongue-in-cheek science fiction comedy that remains the most expensive
Czech film ever made, while his 1995 follow-up <a href="fberlin96-4.html#The Ride" target="_top"><i>The
Ride</i></a> (<i>Jizda</i>) takes a 180-degree turn in its laid-back road movie tale of
three disaffected youths and their summer sojourn across the Czech Republic by car
(tellingly, on this project, Zdenek Sverak is nowhere to be found). <i>Kolya</i> is the
first film written by Sverak pere specifically for Sverak fils. </p>

<p>Markedly different one from the other in style, tone and budget, Jan Sverak's ouevre to
date seems a conscious effort by a filmmaker of great flexibility and ambition to work in
as many voices as possible. Could Sverak the Younger go Hollywood? He's got the skill and
the tools and perhaps the desire and after <i>Kolya</i> probably the opportunity. Yet he's
insisted in interviews that he has no interest in compromising his vision to make films.
What remains to be seen is the degree to which he wants to give up his hard-learned
lessons and temper his natural talent in the service of an industry in which individuality
is rarely rewarded but the individual is. Francois Truffaut, himself a director blessed by
a delicate rapport with children, made one English language film (<i>Fahrenheit 451</i>)
and vowed to never make another one. The success of <i>Kolya</i> will tell the tale. </p>

<p>Significantly, the shrewd release pattern of <i>Kolya</i> in the United States
positions it to be the most talked-about foreign language film in wide distribution as the
Academy Award nominees are announced (11 February). That it has already won the Golden
Globe award in that category virtually insures that it will make the Oscar cut. Should <i>Kolya</i>
win, it would become the first film from the former Czechoslovakia to receive the award
since <i>Closely Watched Trains</i> precisely 30 years ago. That's a long enough draught
for a national cinema of such power and importance, as well as a significant tribute to
Zdenek Sverak's distinguished body of work to date and the impressive potential of Jan
Sverak on the world stage. <i>Kolya</i> is domestically produced film of international
importance, a lovingly made and universally understandable tribute to the resiliency of
children to adversity, the essential decency in even the stodgiest of adults and, in the
words of Zdenek Sverak, &quot;some good in every misfortune, and the other way
round.&quot; </p>
