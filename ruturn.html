<p><font size="3">Many comparisons have been made between <i>U-Turn</i> and its presumed
predecessors in <i>film</i> <i>noir</i>; one critic referred to the film as <i>Touch of
Evil</i> mixed with <i>Duel in the Sun</i>. Stone himself prefers to think of <i>U-Turn</i>
as more of a western than a <i>noir</i> piece. A more immediate comparison might be made
between <em>U-Turn</em> and John Dahl's 1993 neo-<em>noir</em>, <em>Red Rock West</em>.
However, in terms of narrative structure, <i>U-Turn&#146;s</i> closest cinematic
&quot;relative&quot; really has to be the Edgar G. Ulmer <i>noir</i> classic from 1946, <i>Detour</i>.
Both films share the common dilemma of a spineless antihero caught in a relentlessly
downward spiral, a position exacerbated by allowing a sinister female into his life. <img src="images/ruturn-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="200">Every more he takes to
extricate himself just causes the level of misery to accelerate. Not surprisingly, this
type of <i>noir</i> can be extremely difficult for the audience to tolerate for very long,
precisely because the grim route taken by the antihero is so lacking in self-awareness
that, under the force of an overwhelmingly negative pressure-cooker atmosphere, disgust
mixed with despair soon sets in &#150; a fatal combination of forces with which to hold an
audience in thrall. However, because of studio and budgetary considerations (the film was
shot over four days), Ulmer was obliged to keep the torture down to sixty-nine minutes of
running time; these factors saved <i>Detour</i> from becoming a B-movie exercise in
nihilistic self-indulgence and rendered it a minor masterpiece in retrospect. Just as <i>Detour</i>
began to tax the nerves beyond endurance, the ending, with its macabre twist, intervened
to save everyone from nervous enervation. In this case, it was better to end the downbeat
on the upbeat. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Unfortunately, this is not the tack taken by Stone and Ridley. The
problem doesn&#146;t stem from the traditional sources of too much money and too much time
for shooting (Stone, to his credit, shot <i>U-Turn</i> for twenty million dollars &#150; a
veritable fire-sale price in contemporary Hollywood &#150; and in forty-two days, almost a
third less time than is normal for him). <img src="images/ruturn-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Had the two also employed economy in crafting the plot structure,
everything should have worked out according to plan. Instead, they allow events in
Superior, Arizona to drag out endlessly for at least half an hour too long. There
aren&#146;t enough unique plot variations suggested by the environment to effectively
nurture this delay (cities are a better setting for this type of film, suggesting, as they
do, a myriad of possibilities denied to your average one-horse hamlet), so Stone and
Ridley are reduced to piling devastation upon devastation on Cooper&#146;s back as a form
of filler, and the efforts seem so contrived that they simply seem ludicrous. By the time
the film gets itself back on the road, to what otherwise would have been (should have
been?) a stunning finale, the film&#146;s momentum has been inexorably depleted, as the
audience&#146;s interest has been strung past the breaking point. Forget the concept of
&quot;compassion fatigue;&quot; the audience with which I saw <i>U-Turn</i> was suffering
from something far more severe: &quot;identification fatigue;&quot; the audience had
nothing left to give to the film, and simply wanted the conclusion to emerge as quickly as
possible. Not even generous amounts of over-the-top humor and immaculate, striking visuals
could salvage it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The larceny committed upon <i>U-Turn</i> by its own makers, which can
only be described as vampiric, is inexcusable because there are a number of grand
performances in this ensemble cast. Obviously, Penn, with his multilayered portrayal of
the freedom-craving Cooper confirms his position as one of the finest actors of his
generation, but Phoenix, remembered best as the teenage killer in <i>To Die For</i>,
carves out a new dimension for himself as TNT, the teenage nut case. Nolte is extremely
impressive as the evil Jake, and Thornton is underhandedly brilliant as the malevolently
hilarious mechanic. Unfortunately, <i>U-Turn</i> takes all of their talents into a dead
end. </font></p>
