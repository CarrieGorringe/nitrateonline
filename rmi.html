Despite the necessarily formulaic nature of the series (which ran on the ABC television network from 1966 to 1973), with villains always being vanquished no matter what narrative twists and turns had to be employed to put them in that condition, the series generally contained a sufficiently high level of suspense as to the means of defeat, a suspense dependent upon the use of presumably extant but covert gadgetry. No matter that some of the gadgets looked so unabashedly cheesy, because so beyond the scope of then-current technology, that their efficacy seemed doubtful at best (one memorable episode employed a 16mm film, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs to deceive a dictator).

Both audience and series were willing to push the envelope in the electronic frontier, providing that there seemed to be some logical consistency maintained between products and the plot line.">

<p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="4">n re-watching some of the
episodes of the old <em>Mission: Impossible</em> series just after having seen the new big
screen version, the contrast between the two hit me like the proverbial thunderbolt. Other
than the obvious differences between cast, budget size and special effects, there was one
other, far more glaring discrepancy, namely that the series had not been afraid of taking
chances with its audience&#146;s intelligence. Despite the necessarily formulaic nature of
the series (which ran on the ABC television network from 1966 to 1973), with villains
always being vanquished no matter what narrative twists and turns had to be employed to
put them in that condition, the series generally contained a sufficiently high level of
suspense as to the means of defeat, a suspense dependent upon the use of presumably extant
but covert gadgetry. No matter that some of the gadgets looked so unabashedly cheesy,
because so beyond the scope of then-current technology, that their efficacy seemed
doubtful at best (one memorable episode employed a 16mm film, and the use of
hallucinogenic drugs to deceive a dictator). The success of the entire enterprise hinged
on the fact that the series&#146; audiences believed in the potential of the electronic
avant-garde -- the great economic and military strength of the US during the &#145;60s
playing no small role in creating that belief -- and so were willing to suspend whatever
qualms they had about anything they saw. Both audience and series were willing to push the
envelope in the electronic frontier, providing that there seemed to be some logical
consistency maintained between products and the plot line.</font></p>

<p>Likewise with the career of Brian De Palma, who used to be a risk-taker of sorts.
Although much of the work done in the early part of his career was warmed-over Hitchcock
or Antonioni, he was still able to take these remaindered elements and fashion them into a
unique trashiness that was really fun to watch (his 1978 film, <em>The Fury</em>, is still
one of my guiltiest of pleasures). At some point (probably after the critical and
commercial failure of <em>Body Double</em> in 1984, De Palma seemed to mutate into a
merely workmanlike director. This is not to say that 1987&#146;s, <em>The Untouchables</em>
was less than entertaining, because it most assuredly was, but De Palma&#146;s handling of
the film fell under the category of necessary, but not sufficient.</p>

<p>And so it is with this film. The surface of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> is so slick
that everything just glides right off it, up to and including most vestiges of
entertainment. The film works -- and just barely -- only because the narrative flies at
warp speed; there&#146;s no time to think about gaping holes in the plot and gross
violations of the fundamental laws of physics, not to mention credibility, when you finish
hurtling in the course of two hours across the Atlantic Ocean and back only to find
yourself hurtling through the Chunnel with no chance to catch your breath. The plot, as
such, involves the desperate attempts that agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must make in an
attempt to clear his name after a nighttime mission in Prague goes terribly wrong and all
of the agents but he are murdered, including his immediate supervisor, Jim Phelps
(Voight), and information has been stolen. So Hunt enlists a group of rogue agents and
Phelps&#146; widow (Beart) to accomplish the task. The sequence in Prague is indeed
suspenseful, and demonstrates the exciting direction this film could have taken. Instead,
even with the melange of technological and geographic razzle-dazzle at the crew&#146;s
disposal, there is very little joy in this film; the overall effect on screen bears more
than a passing resemblance to what might have occurred with a hypothetical pairing of
James Cameron and John Calvin; the decision to eliminate over seventy-five per cent of the
cast within the first forty minutes doesn&#146;t help the situation very much. There is no
denying that this film has other great, if implausible, moments, such as the
&quot;computer room&quot; sequence cited in all of the trailers with Cruise playing a
high-tech Pinocchio, but that&#146;s all this film has -- great moments strung together
with very little substance. It is also apparent that some major and last-minute editing
was performed; one entire subplot involving Hunt and Mrs. Phelps is so obscured throughout
the film that its sudden reappearance at the end of the film is as much a surprise as a
clarification of audience expectations. Unfortunately, as everything else indicates,
editing was not the means by which to save <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.</p>

<p>Apparently, first-time producer Cruise wanted to hedge as many bets as possible in
creating a secure market niche for this film, and he has succeeded to the probable tune of
at least $200 million, but the cost to the end product was incalculable. Only when the
peerless Vanessa Redgrave appears on screen to deliver an elegantly sexy and witty
performance, at intervals too infrequent for sustained relief, is any measure of heat
detectable. A brief, if inspired (and uncredited), appearance by Emilio Estevez as a
computer nerd and Ving Rhames&#146; role as a cynically bemused computer expert are also
welcome oasis&#146;s in a cinematic desert. The movie version of <em>Mission: Impossible</em>
dangles on the edge of self-destruction, though it takes somewhat longer than five seconds
for the realization to hit home. </p>
